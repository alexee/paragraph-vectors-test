A chair is a piece of furniture with a raised surface commonly used to seat a single person. Chairs are supported most often by four legs and have a back;[1][2] however, a chair can have three legs or could have a different shape.[3] Chairs are made of a wide variety of materials, ranging from wood to metal to man made material, and they may be padded or upholstered, either just on the seat or on the entire chair (e.g., with a La-Z-Boy chair). Chairs are used in a number of rooms in homes (e.g., in living rooms, dining rooms and dens), in schools and offices (with desks) and in various other workplaces.

A chair without a back or arm rests is a stool,[4] or when raised up, a bar stool.[5] A chair with arms is an armchair[6] and with upholstery, reclining action and a fold-out footrest, a recliner.[7] A permanently fixed chair in a train or theater is a seat[8] or, in an airplane, airline seat;[citation needed] when riding, it is a saddle[citation needed] and bicycle saddle,[citation needed] and for an automobile, a car seat[citation needed] or infant car seat.[citation needed] With wheels it is a wheelchair[9] and when hung from above, a swing.[citation needed]

An upholstered, padded chair for more than one person is a couch, sofa, settee, or "loveseat";[10] or if is not upholstered, a bench.[11] A separate footrest for a chair, usually upholstered, is known as an ottoman,[12] hassock[13] or pouffe.[14]
