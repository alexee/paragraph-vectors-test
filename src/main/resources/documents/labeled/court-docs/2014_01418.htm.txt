	Lauren Bisk, Appellant,
v
Cooper Square Realty,
Inc., et al., Respondents, et al., Defendants.


—[*1]


Lauren Bisk, appellant pro se.

Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith LLP, New York (Ellen E. Mooney of counsel), for
Cooper Square Realty, Inc., respondent.

Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman & Dicker LLP, New York (William F. Cusack III
of counsel), for Boulevard Housing Corp., and Edward Vincent, respondents.



Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Joan A. Madden, J.), entered April 26,
2012, which granted a motion by pro se plaintiff's former counsel Meister Seelig and
Fein to the extent of directing it to pay $14,000 it was holding in escrow to Travelers
Bond and Financial Products, the insurer of defendant Cooper Square Realty, Inc.,
granted Cooper Square's cross motion to compel Meister Seelig to release the $14,000 to
Travelers, and denied plaintiff's motion to retain a portion of the $14,000 as liquidated
damages or to rescind the settlement agreement, unanimously affirmed, without costs.

The court properly denied plaintiff's request to rescind the settlement agreement
where plaintiff failed to show that defendants' delay of two days in making full payment
on the settlement agreement was a material and willful breach, so substantial and
fundamental as to strongly tend to defeat the object of the parties in making the contract
(see Callanan v Keeseville, Ausable Chasm & Lake Champlain R.R. Co., 199
NY 268, 284 [1910]; Lasker-Goldman Corp. v City of New York, 221 AD2d
153 [1st Dept 1995], lv dismissed 87 NY2d 1055 [1996]). This minor delay in
full payment is immaterial in light of the fact that there is no indication in the agreement
that time was of the essence with respect to the payment of the settlement amount (see
Luo v Main St. Assoc., 212 AD2d 675 [2d Dept 1995]), or other special
circumstances surrounding the execution of the agreement indicating as much (see
Whitney v Perry, 208 AD2d 1025 [3d Dept 1994]). Nor did plaintiff show that the
delays in payment were willful.

Given the absence of a contractual provision providing that defendants would be in
default upon failure to make full payment upon the specified date or providing for
liquidated damages in the event of any delay in payment, the court properly denied
plaintiff's request to [*2]retain a portion of the $14,000
held in escrow that constituted an inadvertent overpayment of the settlement amount
owed by defendants and was properly returnable to the insurance company that made the
overpayment. Concur—Tom, J.P., Friedman, Acosta, Andrias and Richter, JJ.
