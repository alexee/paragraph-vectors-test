Defendants.

Cullen and Dykman, LLP, New York, N.Y. (Joseph Miller of counsel), for
appellant.

Ronemus & Vilensky, LLP, New York, N.Y. (Robin Mary Heaney of counsel), for
respondents.



In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, etc., the defendant
Incorporated Village of Garden City appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Nassau
County (Feinman, J.), entered July 27, 2012, which denied its motion for summary
judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against it.

Ordered that the order is reversed, on the law, with costs, and the motion of the
defendant Incorporated Village of Garden City for summary judgment dismissing the
complaint insofar as asserted against it is granted.

On February 17, 2010, at about 9:30 p.m., the plaintiff Anthony Berardi (hereinafter
the injured plaintiff) allegedly slipped and fell on top of an interior set of steps which
was wet, shiny, and slippery. As a result, the plaintiff and his wife, suing derivatively,
commenced this action against, among others, the Incorporated Village of Garden City,
which owned the premises. The Village moved for summary judgment dismissing the
complaint insofar as asserted against it, contending that it did not create the alleged
hazardous condition which caused the fall or have actual or constructive notice of it. The
Supreme Court denied the motion, and the Village appeals.

The Village established its prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law by
demonstrating that it did not create the alleged hazardous condition that caused the fall or
have actual or constructive notice of it (see Rivera v 2160 Realty Co., L.L.C., 4 NY3d 837 [2005];
Perez v New York City Hous.
Auth., 75 AD3d 629 [2010]; Muniz v New York City Hous. Auth., 38 AD3d 628
[2007]). In support of the motion, the Village submitted the deposition testimony and
affidavit of its senior maintainer, who was responsible for cleaning the premises.
According to the senior maintainer, when he last inspected the premises on February 17,
2010, between 3:00 and 4:00 p.m., he did not notice any hazardous condition at the top
of the subject staircase (see
Slintak v Price Chopper Supermarkets, 81 AD3d 808 [2011]; Crapanzano v Balkon Realty
Co., 68 AD3d 1042 [2009]). The Village also submitted evidence which
demonstrated that it did not receive any complaints about the condition of the top of the
subject staircase between the time it was last inspected and the time of the injured
plaintiff's accident. In opposition, the plaintiffs failed to raise a triable issue of fact. The
affidavits of Christian McGannon and Elizabeth McGannon, wherein they alleged that
they slipped and fell on the same staircase four days prior to the accident, failed to raise a
triable issue of fact as to whether the [*2]condition that
had caused them to fall was the same condition that allegedly caused the injured plaintiff
to fall (see Barrera v City of
New York, 60 AD3d 983, 984 [2009]; Waheed v Valley Stream Cent. High School Dist., 54 AD3d
1028, 1029 [2008]).

Accordingly, the Supreme Court should have granted the Village's motion for
summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against it. Skelos, J.P.,
Chambers, Hall and Miller, JJ., concur.
