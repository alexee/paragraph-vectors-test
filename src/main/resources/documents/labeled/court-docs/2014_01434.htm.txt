—[*1]



Schlissel Ostrow Karabatos, PLLC, Garden City, N.Y. (Stephen W. Schlissel,
Jennifer Rosenkrantz, and Hillary Reinharz of counsel), for appellant.

Abrams, Fensterman, Fensterman, Eisman, Formato, Ferrara & Einiger LLP, Lake
Success, N.Y. (Steven J. Eisman and Michael E. Ratner of counsel), for respondent.

Chas G. Cancellare, Hauppauge, N.Y., attorney for the child.



In an action for a divorce and ancillary relief, the defendant appeals, by permission,
from an order of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (Bivona, J.), dated August 19,
2013, which, upon finding that the State of California was the more appropriate forum to
determine any custody and visitation matters affecting the parties' child, declined to
continue to exercise jurisdiction over such matters.

Ordered that the order is affirmed, without costs or disbursements.

A court of this State which has jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody
Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (Domestic Relations Law art 5-A) may decline to
exercise jurisdiction if it finds that New York is an inconvenient forum and that a court
of another state is a more appropriate forum (see Domestic Relations Law
§ 76-f [1]; Matter of
Hassan v Silva, 100 AD3d 753, 754 [2012]). The factors to be considered in
making this determination include the length of time the subject child has resided outside
the state, any agreement between the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction,
the nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, the
ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures
necessary to present the evidence, and the familiarity of the court of each state with the
facts and issues in the pending litigation (see Domestic Relations Law §
76-f [2]; Matter of Hassan v Silva, 100 AD3d at 754; Matter of Paderno v
Shvetsova, 96 AD3d 762, 763 [2012]). "Particularly relevant to the
jurisdictional determination is whether the forum in which the litigation is to proceed has
optimum access to relevant evidence" (Vanneck v Vanneck, 49 NY2d 602, 610
[1980] [citation and internal quotation marks omitted]; see Matter of Paderno v
Shvetsova, 96 AD3d at 763). "Maximum rather than minimum contacts with the
State are required" (Vanneck v Vanneck, 49 NY2d at 610; see Matter of
Paderno v Shvetsova, 96 AD3d at 763).

Here, the subject child has lived in California since August 2011 with the permission
[*2]of the defendant, who maintains a residence in Utah.
The record provides a substantial basis for the Family Court's finding that the evidence
regarding the child's care, well being, and personal relationships is more readily available
in California. There is no evidence that the child retained substantial connections with
New York or that significant evidence existed in this State. The Superior Court of Napa
County, California (hereinafter the California court) is familiar with the family and the
pending issues, and that court is willing to exercise jurisdiction. Additionally, an attorney
for the child based in the same state as the child can far more effectively communicate
with the child than an attorney across the country (see Matter of Paderno v
Shvetsova, 96 AD3d at 763). Although the parties had previously agreed, in August
2011, that New York would retain jurisdiction of custody and visitation matters, such
agreement was outweighed by the other relevant factors. Accordingly, the Family Court
providently exercised its discretion in concluding that the State of California is the more
appropriate and convenient forum to determine the matters of custody and visitation
(see Domestic Relations Law § 76-f; Matter of Hassan v Silva, 100
AD3d at 754-755; Matter of Paderno v Shvetsova, 96 AD3d at 763-764; Matter of Boyd v Crepeau, 89
AD3d 1020, 1020 [2011]; Matter of Toale v Caravella, 86 AD3d 576, 576 [2011]).
Skelos, J.P., Lott, Roman and Cohen, JJ., concur.
