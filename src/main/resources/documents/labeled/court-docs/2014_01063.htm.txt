v
Jayme I. Frontuto, Appellant.

The Legal Aid Bureau of Buffalo, Inc., Buffalo (Barbara J. Davies of counsel),
for defendant-appellant.

Frank A. Sedita, III, District Attorney, Buffalo (David A. Heraty of counsel), for
respondent.



Appeal from a judgment of the Erie County Court (Sheila A. DiTullio, J.), rendered
June 5, 2012. The judgment convicted defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of criminal
possession of a weapon in the second degree and unlawful possession of marihuana.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.

Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon his plea of
guilty of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree (Penal Law §
265.03 [3]) and unlawful possession of marihuana (§ 221.05). As the People
correctly concede, because "[n]o mention of youthful offender status was made before
defendant waived his right to appeal during the plea colloquy" (People v Anderson, 90 AD3d
1475, 1476 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 991 [2012]), defendant's waiver of
the right to appeal does not encompass his contention regarding County Court's denial of
his request for youthful offender status. We nevertheless reject defendant's contention
that the court abused its discretion in denying that request (see People v Lugo, 87 AD3d
1403, 1405 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 860 [2011]). The remedial measures
of People v Rudolph (21
NY3d 497, 499 [2013]) do not apply to the circumstances of this case.
Present—Smith, J.P., Fahey, Carni, Valentino and Whalen, JJ.
