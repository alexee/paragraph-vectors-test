	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Tracy Byrdsong, Appellant.


—[*1]


Richard M. Greenberg, Office of the Appellate Defender, New York (Rebekah
J. PazmiÑo of counsel), for appellant.

Robert T. Johnson, District Attorney, Bronx (David P. Johnson of counsel), for
respondent.



Judgment, Supreme Court, Bronx County (Peter J. Benitez, J.), rendered July 1,
2010, as amended July 23, 2010, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of
attempted robbery in the second degree, and sentencing him, as a persistent violent
felony offender, to a term of 12 years to life, unanimously affirmed.

Defendant's prosecution by superior court information did not violate the
constitutional provision against waiver of indictment by a person charged with "an
offense . . . punishable by death or life imprisonment" (NY Const, art I,
§ 6), even though he ultimately received a life sentence as a persistent violent
felony offender (see People v Melendez, 210 AD2d 74 [1st Dept 1994], lv
denied 85 NY2d 940 [1995]; see also People v Sherman, 221 AD2d 813 [3d
Dept 1995], lv denied 87 NY2d 925 [1996]). A life sentence is mandatory for a
person adjudicated a persistent violent felony offender. Nevertheless, at the time
defendant waived indictment, he was not charged with an offense punishable by life
imprisonment. He was held on a felony complaint in which the highest charge was
robbery in the first degree, a class B felony carrying a maximum sentence of 25 years. A
conviction could have become the basis for a life sentence only upon completion of the
procedures set forth in CPL article 400. Concur—Tom, J.P., Friedman, Saxe,
Richter and Clark, JJ.
