	The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v
Patrick Hughes, Appellant.


—[*1]



Matthew C. Hug, Troy, for appellant.

P. David Soares, District Attorney, Albany (Steven M. Sharp of counsel), for
respondent.



Rose, J. Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Teresi, J.), rendered June 5,
2012 in Albany County, upon a verdict convicting defendant of the crimes of predatory
sexual assault against a child, rape in the first degree, rape in the second degree and
endangering the welfare of a child (three counts).

When the police located defendant's 16-year-old stepdaughter after she ran away
from home, she told them that she had been subjected to physical and sexual abuse by the
39-year-old defendant. He then voluntarily spoke with police and, in a video-recorded
interview, gave a written statement in which he admitted that he had "disciplined" the
victim by making her fellate him and have sexual intercourse with him on at least four
separate occasions. As a result, defendant was charged with predatory sexual assault
against a child, rape in the first degree, rape in the second degree and three counts of
endangering the welfare of a child. Following a jury trial, he was convicted as charged
and Supreme Court sentenced him to an aggregate prison term of 50 years to life.
Defendant now appeals.

Contrary to defendant's contention, the conviction for predatory sexual assault
against a child is based on legally sufficient evidence of the time period when the
underlying crime occurred (see Penal Law § 130.96). As alleged in the
indictment and charged to the jury, this count required proof that defendant committed
the underlying crime of rape in the first degree [*2]between June 23, 2006 and September 6, 2006, when the
victim was less than 13 years old (see Penal Law § 130.35 [4]). The victim
testified that the first incident of sexual intercourse occurred in the summer before she
started sixth grade, which was shown to be during the time period charged and thereby
established when the sexual intercourse was alleged to have occurred.

We also reject defendant's claim that the jury's verdict was contrary to the weight of
the evidence. The video recording of his interview with the police makes clear that he
was not coerced and it belies his characterization of his admissions as equivocal and
unreliable. While he initially denied the allegations during the interview and then
claimed that he had had a drinking problem that prevented him from remembering
anything, he soon admitted to oral sexual conduct and sexual intercourse with the victim
and described it as a way of disciplining her. Significantly, he provided his interviewers
with telling details concerning occasions and locations that they had not previously
disclosed to him during the course of the interview. For her part, the victim testified
unequivocally as to the acts of physical and sexual abuse perpetrated by defendant
against her, and the issue of her own credibility was fully explored at trial. Defendant
also testified on his own behalf, but the jury rejected his denial that any of the previously
admitted conduct had actually occurred and his improbable claim that he had merely told
police what they wanted to hear in the confused hope that they would release him and
then vindicate him after further investigation. According great deference to the jury's
opportunity to view the witnesses, hear their testimony and observe their demeanor, we
can find no basis to disturb its verdict as against the weight of the evidence (see People v Sorrell, 108
AD3d 787, 789-790 [2013]; People v Hayes, 104 AD3d 1050, 1053 [2013], lv
denied 
22 NY3d 1041 [2013]; People v
Reynolds, 81 AD3d 1166, 1167 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 898
[2011]).

Nor can we agree with defendant's contention—preserved by means of an oral
motion in limine—that the sole aim of the testimony of a child protective services
caseworker was to improperly bolster the victim's testimony. The entire extent of the
caseworker's testimony regarding the victim's prior consistent statements was that "[s]he
was reporting that she was sexually abused by [defendant] from the age, I believe, of ten
till approximately eighth grade." The main purpose of this testimony was to describe the
victim's fearful reaction to learning that defendant was nearby in the police station and to
describe the reaction of the victim's mother to the caseworker's report to her of her
daughter's allegations. According to the caseworker, the victim's mother, to whom the
victim had previously complained of the abuse to no avail, had discredited and
disregarded the victim's allegations. This testimony was relevant to explain the victim's
apparent delay in disclosing the abuse. Even if we were to consider the caseworker's
testimony to constitute improper bolstering, her repetition of the victim's allegation was
brief in the overall context of her testimony, the People did not rely on it as direct
evidence of defendant's guilt and, given the overwhelming nature of the evidence,
including defendant's own written statement and the video recording of his interview
with the police, any error in its admission would be harmless (see People v Grady, 40 AD3d
1368, 1373 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 923 [2007]; People v Dunn,
204 AD2d 919, 921 [1994], lv denied 84 NY2d 907 [1994]).

Defendant's similar argument that two police witnesses also engaged in improper
bolstering was not preserved for our review by an appropriate objection at trial. Were we
to review it, however, we would find that this testimony was limited to a brief repetition
of the general allegation of sexual abuse made by the victim, without reference to any
time frame or other details. It was given only as background information to explain the
actions of the police and was not relied on by the People as direct evidence of defendant's
guilt (see People v
Galloway, 93 AD3d 1069, 1072 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 996 [2012];
People v Terry, 85 [*3]AD3d 1485, 1488 n 3
[2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 862 [2011]; see also People v Shepherd, 83 AD3d 1298, 1301 [2011],
lv denied 17 NY3d 809 [2011]).

Photographs of text messages sent from defendant's cell phone to the victim were
properly authenticated and we find no error in their admission. " '[A]uthenticity is
established by proof that the offered evidence is genuine and that there has been no
tampering with it,' and '[t]he foundation necessary to establish these elements may differ
according to the nature of the evidence sought to be admitted' " (People v Clevenstine, 68
AD3d 1448, 1450 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 799 [2010], quoting
People v McGee, 49 NY2d 48, 59 [1979]). Here, the People produced testimony
from a Verizon employee confirming that text messages had been sent between certain
phone numbers, the victim identified the phone numbers as belonging to her and
defendant, and she identified the photographs as depicting text messages she received
from him. Defendant's testimony that someone else could have sent the messages from
his phone presented a factual issue for the jury, and we discern no basis for setting the
jury's determination aside (see
People v Green, 107 AD3d 915, 916-917 [2013]; People v Clevenstine,
68 AD3d at 1451).

Nor are we persuaded by defendant's argument that the expert testimony concerning
how children respond to sexual abuse should have been precluded. It is well settled that
testimony to explain the range of behaviors of sexually abused
children—including why they may delay in reporting sexual abuse—may be
admitted as beyond the ordinary understanding of the average juror (see People v
Carroll, 95 NY2d 375, 387 [2000]). Here, the People's expert testified about these
behaviors generally in an effort to counter negative inferences urged by defendant's
counsel and did not attempt to impermissibly prove that the victim had been sexually
abused (see People v
Spicola, 16 NY3d 441, 465 [2011], cert denied 565 US
—, 132 S Ct 400 [2011]; People v Rich, 78 AD3d 1200, 1202 [2010], lv
denied 17 NY3d 799 [2011]; People v Gregory, 78 AD3d 1246, 1247 [2010], lv
denied 16 NY3d 831 [2011]).

Defendant's challenge to the sixth count of the indictment charging endangering the
welfare of a child as being duplicitous is also without merit. By its nature, the crime of
endangering the welfare of a child "may be committed either by one act or by multiple
acts and readily permits characterization as a continuing offense over a period of time"
(People v Keindl, 68 NY2d 410, 421 [1986]). The general rule that a count is
duplicitous if it charges more than one crime "does not apply to continuing crimes, such
as . . . endangering the welfare of a child" (People v Dalton, 27 AD3d
779, 781 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 754 [2006]). Here, the count properly set
forth allegations that defendant had repeatedly subjected family members, including a
pet, to physical abuse in the presence of the victim (see People v Chilson, 285
AD2d 733, 734 [2001], lv denied 97 NY2d 640 [2001]; People v
Dunavin, 173 AD2d 1032, 1033 [1991], lv denied 78 NY2d 965 [1991]).

Defendant's remaining arguments were not preserved for our review (see
CPL 470.05 [2]), and their inclusion in his posttrial CPL 330.30 motion is insufficient to
preserve them as issues for appeal (see People v Padro, 75 NY2d 820, 821
[1990]; People v Richard,
30 AD3d 750, 755 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 869 [2006]). In any event,
were we to address them, we would find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the
failure to raise these objections at trial did not deprive defendant of meaningful
representation (see People v
Sudler, 75 AD3d 901, 906 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 956 [2010]).
Rather, the record reveals that trial counsel made appropriate pretrial motions, presented
cogent opening and closing statements, pursued a reasonable defense, vigorously
cross-examined the People's witnesses, presented an expert to rebut the People's expert
witness and raised appropriate objections throughout the trial. Viewing [*4]the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that
defendant received the effective assistance of counsel (see People v Green, 108 AD3d
782, 786 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1074 [2013]; People v Sorrell,
108 AD3d at 794; People v Terry, 85 AD3d at 1488-1489).

Finally, we find no merit to defendant's contention that his sentence was harsh and
excessive. Given the relationship between defendant and his young victim, the length of
time over which he sexually abused her, his admission that he did so as a form of
discipline, together with his prior criminal history, we cannot say that Supreme Court
abused its sentencing discretion. Nor do we find extraordinary circumstances warranting
modification in the interest of justice (see People v Jabaut, 111 AD3d 1140, 1148 [2013]; People v Warner, 110 AD3d
1339, 1340-1341 [2013]; People v Shultis, 61 AD3d 1116, 1118 [2009], lv
denied 12 NY3d 929 [2009]; People v Greene, 13 AD3d 991, 993-994 [2004], lv
denied 5 NY3d 789 [2005]).

Peters, P.J., McCarthy and Garry, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
