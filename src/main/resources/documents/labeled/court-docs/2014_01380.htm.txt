	In the Matter of Justice T., a Person Alleged to be a
Juvenile Delinquent, Appellant.


—[*1]


Tamara A. Steckler, The Legal Aid Society, New York (Mark Dellaquila of
counsel), for appellant.

Michael A. Cardozo, Corporation Counsel, New York (Drake A. Colley of counsel),
for presentment agency.


Order of disposition, Family Court, Bronx County (Sidney Gribetz, J.), entered on or
about February 4, 2013, which adjudicated appellant a juvenile delinquent upon a
fact-finding determination that he committed acts that, if committed by an adult, would
constitute the crimes of attempted arson in the third degree and reckless endangerment in
the second degree, and placed him on probation for a period of 12 months, unanimously
affirmed, without costs.

The court's finding was based on legally sufficient evidence and was not against the
weight of the evidence (see
People v Danielson, 9 NY3d 342, 348-349 [2007]). There is no basis for
disturbing the court's credibility determinations, including its conclusion that at the time
appellant placed a match in the opening of a car's gas tank, the match was lit.
Concur—Tom, J.P., Friedman, Saxe, Richter and Clark, JJ.
