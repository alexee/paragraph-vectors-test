	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Isaiah Bridges, Appellant.


—[*1]


Lynn W.L. Fahey, New York, N.Y. (Melissa S. Horlick of counsel), for
appellant.

Kenneth P. Thompson, District Attorney, Brooklyn, N.Y. (Leonard Joblove, Ann
Bordley, and Claibourne I. Henry of counsel), for respondent.


Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (J.
Goldberg, J.), rendered November 29, 2010, convicting him of criminal sexual act in the
first degree (two counts), burglary in the second degree, and petit larceny, upon a jury
verdict, and imposing sentence.

Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.

The defendant's contention that he was deprived of a fair trial by improper remarks
made by the prosecutor during summation is unpreserved for appellate review (see People v Santos, 105
AD3d 1064, 1065 [2013]). In any event, the challenged remarks were fair comment
on the evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom or responsive to
defense counsel's summation (see People v Bryant, 39 AD3d 768, 769 [2007]; People v Siriani, 27 AD3d
670 [2006]).

Defense counsel's failure to object to certain of the prosecutor's challenged remarks
during summation did not deprive the defendant of the effective assistance of counsel
under the New York Constitution (see People v Floyd, 97 AD3d 837, 838 [2012]; People v Anderson, 24 AD3d
460 [2005]), or under the United States Constitution (see Strickland v
Washington, 466 US 668 [1984]).

The sentence imposed was not excessive (see People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80
[1982]).

The defendant's remaining contention is unpreserved for appellate review and, in any
event, without merit. Rivera, J.P., Hall, Roman and Miller, JJ., concur.
