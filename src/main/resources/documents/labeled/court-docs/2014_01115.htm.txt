—[*1]


The Law Offices of Richard B. Rosenthal, P.A., Miami, FL (Richard B.
Rosenthal of the bars of the States of California and Florida, admitted pro hac vice, of
counsel), for appellant.

Smith, Gambrell & Russell, LLP, New York (Donald L. Rosenthal of counsel), for
respondent.



Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Anil C. Singh, J.), entered August 19,
2013, dismissing the complaint, unanimously modified, on the law, to vacate the
dismissal and to declare that plaintiff has no right to renew its lease after the lease expires
in 2024, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs. Appeal from order, same court and
Justice, entered on or about June 18, 2013, unanimously dismissed, without costs, as
subsumed in the appeal from the judgment.

The lease on plaintiff tenant's commercial space unambiguously provides that it may
be renewed for a term commencing March 1, 2024 and expiring March 1, 2045 if, inter
alia, defendant landlord has, in its discretion, exercised its right to renew its ground lease
for the same period. That plaintiff's lease renewal is conditioned on defendant's renewing
its ground lease is also stated in two documents prepared contemporaneously with the
lease, i.e., a "Memorandum of Lease" and the offering plan issued by defendant, a
cooperative corporation. Plaintiff, which was the tenant under the ground lease,
sponsored the 1974 conversion to cooperative use; it became the tenant of the
commercial space, and its interest in the ground lease was assigned to defendant. Once
defendant was named the primary tenant on the ground lease, it was reasonably
foreseeable that defendant could chose, for any reason whatsoever, not to renew the
ground lease (see Futterman v South African Airways, 126 Misc 2d 90, 92 [Sup
Ct, NY County 1984, Saxe, J.]). Notwithstanding, plaintiff, which drafted the lease
renewal provisions during the conversion process, failed to provide for an obligation
requiring defendant to renew the ground lease under all circumstances. Defendant's
decision to not renew the ground lease, when it became the owner of the fee, was entirely
consistent with the parties' agreement (see Reiss v Financial Performance Corp.,
97 NY2d 195, 199 [2001]). Since the parties' intent is clear from the lease itself, there is
no need to resort to their course of performance thereunder to determine their intent
(W.W.W. Assoc. v Giancontieri, 77 NY2d 157, 162 [1990]). Nor does the
doctrine of prevention or frustration avail plaintiff where the contingency was
foreseeable and defendants' acts were consistent with the agreement (see HGCD Retail Servs., LLC v
44-45 Broadway Realty [*2]Co., 37 AD3d 43,
53-54 [1st Dept 2006]).

We have considered plaintiff's remaining arguments and find them unavailing.
