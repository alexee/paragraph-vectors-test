	In the Matter of Vincent Harrell, Appellant, v Brian
Fischer, as Commissioner of Corrections and Community Supervision,
Respondent.


—[*1]


Vincent Harrell, Attica, appellant pro se.

Eric T. Schneiderman, Attorney General, Albany (Kathleen M. Arnold of counsel),
for respondent.



Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Devine, J.), entered December 5,
2012 in Albany County, which, in a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78, granted
respondent's motion to dismiss the petition.

Petitioner sought to commence a CPLR article 78 proceeding challenging the denial
of his participation in a temporary release program. The order to show cause required
petitioner to serve the papers "by ordinary First Class Mail, upon each named respondent
and upon the Attorney General . . . on or before August 10, 2012."
Respondent moved to dismiss the petition for lack of personal jurisdiction, submitting an
affidavit noting that while it had received "certain papers" from petitioner, the requisite
documents were not received. Notwithstanding petitioner's affidavit of service and
subsequent submission of copies of certified mail receipts indicating that the Attorney
General had received mail from petitioner around the appropriate time period, Supreme
Court granted the motion and dismissed the proceeding. This appeal ensued.

We reverse. A review of the conflicting affidavits and documentation raises
"questions of fact which should have been resolved by a hearing so that credibility and
accuracy could be assessed by a trier of facts" (Steiner v Steiner, 81 AD2d 725,
725 [1981]; see Matter of Elliott
v Butler, 8 NY3d 972, 973 [2007]; Matter of Lopez v Goord, 41 AD3d 992, 993 [2007]).
Accordingly, the judgment must be reversed and the matter must be remitted to Supreme
Court.
[*2]
Lahtinen, J.P., McCarthy, Garry and Egan Jr., JJ.,
concur. Ordered that the judgment is reversed, on the law, without costs, motion denied,
and matter remitted to the Supreme Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with
this Court's decision.
