appellant.

Cynthia Feathers, Glens Falls, for Behzad Anwer, respondent.



Appeal from a decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board, filed August
20, 2012, which ruled that claimant was eligible to receive unemployment insurance
benefits because she had sufficient weeks of covered employment to file a valid original
claim.

From February 2011 until September 2011, claimant worked as a counter manager
selling fragrances for Exclusive Fragrance & Cosmetics, Inc. (hereinafter EFC) at Saks
Fifth Avenue in New York City. After he stopped working for this company, he applied
for unemployment insurance benefits. The Department of Labor concluded that
claimant's base period employment with EFC was not covered employment under Labor
Law § 511 because there was insufficient evidence to establish the existence of an
employment relationship between EFC and claimant. Following a hearing, an
Administrative Law Judge ruled otherwise and found that claimant's work for EFC
constituted covered employment. The Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board upheld
this decision and, consequently, found that claimant was eligible to receive benefits. EFC
now appeals.

We affirm. Initially, the existence of an employment relationship is a factual issue for
the Board to decide and its decision will be not disturbed if supported by substantial
evidence (see Matter of Concourse Ophthalmology Assoc. [Roberts], 60 NY2d
734, 736 [1983]; Matter of
Smith [College Network Inc.—Commissioner of Labor], 109 AD3d
1058, 1059 [2013]). The [*2]pertinent inquiry is
whether the employer exercised control over the results produced or the means used to
achieve those results, with the latter being more important (see Matter of Ted Is Back
Corp. [Roberts], 64 NY2d 725, 726 [1984]; Matter of Zelenka [Versace Profumi
USA—Commissioner of Labor], 304 AD2d 927, 928 [2003]). In the case at
hand, evidence was presented that EFC set claimant's work hours and determined when
he could have time off. In addition, it paid him on a weekly basis at a rate of $27 per
hour, to which he agreed. Furthermore, claimant was in weekly contact with the
vice-president of sales and marketing who discussed with him sales objectives and
promotional activities. In view of this, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the
Board's decision that EFC exercised sufficient control over claimant's activities to
establish the existence of an employment relationship notwithstanding evidence
supporting a contrary conclusion (see Matter of Askew [Nars Cosmetics, Inc.—Commissioner
of Labor], 36 AD3d 1030, 1031 [2007]; Matter of Zelenka [Versace
Profumi USA—Commissioner of Labor], 304 AD3d at 928-929). Therefore,
we find no reason to disturb the Board's decision.

Peters, P.J., Lahtinen, McCarthy and Rose, JJ., concur. Ordered that the decision is
affirmed, without costs.
