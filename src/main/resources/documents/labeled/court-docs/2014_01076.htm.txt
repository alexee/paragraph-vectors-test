v
Demetrius L. Mack, Appellant.

Timothy P. Donaher, Public Defender, Rochester (Jane I. Yoon of counsel), for
defendant-appellant.

Sandra Doorley, District Attorney, Rochester (Nicole M. Fantigrossi of counsel), for
respondent.



Appeal from a judgment of the Monroe County Court (Richard A. Keenan, J.),
rendered December 3, 2009. The judgment convicted defendant, upon his plea of guilty,
of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.

Memorandum: On appeal from a judgment convicting him, upon his plea of guilty,
of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (Penal Law §
220.16 [1]), defendant contends that County Court erred in refusing to suppress the
physical evidence found in his vehicle because the police did not have probable cause to
search the vehicle. Contrary to the People's contention, defendant argued in support of
suppression that the search was unlawful because the police did not have probable cause
and thus preserved his present contention for our review. Nevertheless, we reject
defendant's contention. The police were entitled to stop defendant's vehicle based on his
failure to use his turn signal before turning (see People v Cuffie, 109 AD3d 1200, 1201 [2013]; see
generally Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1163 [a], [b]). Furthermore, the officer
who stopped the vehicle testified at the suppression hearing that he was familiar with the
odor of marihuana, and he detected that odor upon reaching the driver's door. "[I]t is well
established that '[t]he odor of marihuana emanating from a vehicle, when detected by an
officer qualified by training and experience to recognize it, is sufficient to constitute
probable cause' " to search a vehicle (Cuffie, 109 AD3d at 1201; see People v Ponzo, 111 AD3d
1347, 1347-1348 [2013]). Present—Centra, J.P., Peradotto, Lindley, Sconiers
and Whalen, JJ.
