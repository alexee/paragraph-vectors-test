Lahtinen, J. Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court (Krogmann, J.), entered
October 11, 2012 in Warren County, which denied defendant's motion for summary
judgment dismissing the complaint.

In 2009, plaintiff ran for Town Supervisor of the Town of Warrensburg in Warren
County, a position he had previously held from 1988 to 1997. During the campaign, a
political advertisement appeared in a local newspaper that included comments about
defendant, who was the Superintendent of the Town's public works department.
Defendant took offense to those comments. The advertisement indicated that it had been
paid for by the committee to elect plaintiff and Bryan Rounds; Rounds was another
candidate running for a Town office with plaintiff, and Rounds also had a familial
relationship to plaintiff. In response, defendant took out a full page advertisement in the
Glens Falls Post-Star that appeared on election day and included statements that plaintiff
considered defamatory. Plaintiff thus commenced this defamation action and defendant
counterclaimed contending that plaintiff had defamed him in the earlier advertisement.
Following disclosure, defendant moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.
Supreme Court denied the motion and defendant now appeals.

Plaintiff was a public figure (see Chapadeau v Utica Observer-Dispatch, 38
NY2d 196, 198 [1975]) and, as such, he must prove by clear and convincing evidence
that defendant made a false statement with actual malice (see Kipper v NYP Holdings Co.,
Inc., 12 NY3d 348, 353-354[*2][2009]).
Distinguishing actionable fact from a protected expression of opinion is a question of law
in which several factors are weighed, including whether the allegedly defamatory words
have a precise meaning that is readily understood, whether the statement can be proven
as true or false, and whether the context and surrounding circumstances would indicate
that the comment is an opinion (see e.g. Thomas H. v Paul B., 18 NY3d 580, 584 [2012]).
Further, summary judgment dismissing a defamation action may be avoided where the
statement is a " 'mixed opinion' implying a basis in undisclosed fact" or " 'pure opinion'
that accuses the plaintiff of engaging in criminal conduct" (Loder v Nied, 89 AD3d
1197, 1199 [2011]).

Defendant's advertisement announced one of its purposes was "to expose the low
character" of plaintiff. He continued that he had previously "not stooped to [plaintiff's]
level and 'spilled the beans' about numerous unscrupulous dealings [he had] witnessed as
DPW Superintendent during [plaintiff's] several terms in office." Defendant then set
forth in some detail one apparent example of such purported conduct in which plaintiff
allegedly insisted on changing a sewer expansion project at great cost to the Town in
order to receive a significant personal financial benefit. Since defendant's statement
includes both a strong inference that he knows undisclosed facts that support his
assertion that plaintiff engaged in "numerous unscrupulous dealings" when he previously
was Town Supervisor and includes an example that indicated possible unlawful abuse of
that office, we agree with Supreme Court that the statements are sufficiently susceptible
to a defamatory meaning to avoid summary judgment (see Silsdorf v Levine, 59
NY2d 8, 16 [1983], cert denied 464 US 831 [1983]; Loder v Nied, 89
AD3d at 1200).

Moreover, defendant essentially acknowledged at his deposition that he had no basis
for some of his accusations, and when this proof is viewed most favorably to the
nonmovant, there is adequate evidence in the record to raise a triable issue of fact
regarding whether defendant acted with actual malice (see DiFabio v Jordan, 113
AD3d 1109, 1110 [2014]; Curren v Carbonic Sys., Inc., 58 AD3d 1104,
1106-1107 [2009]). The remaining arguments have been considered and are
unpersuasive.

Peters, P.J., Garry and Rose, JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is affirmed, with
costs.
