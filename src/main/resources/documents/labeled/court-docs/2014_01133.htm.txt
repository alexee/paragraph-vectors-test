v

Corporation, Appellant.


—[*1]

Corchia of counsel), for appellant.

respondent.



Judgment, Supreme Court, Bronx County (Mary Ann Brigantti-Hughes, J.), entered
on or about July 17, 2012, upon a jury verdict, awarding plaintiff $150,000 for past pain
and suffering, $150,000 for future pain and suffering, $25,000 for past medical expenses,
and $100,000 for future medical expenses, unanimously modified, on the facts, to vacate
the award for future medical expenses and order a new trial solely as to such damages,
unless plaintiff, within 30 days of service of a copy of this order with notice of entry,
stipulates to accept a reduced award for future medical expenses of $60,000, and to the
entry of an amended judgment in accordance therewith, and otherwise affirmed, without
costs. Appeal from order, same court and Justice, entered on or about December 29,
2011, which, after a jury trial, denied defendant Riverbay Corporation's motion pursuant
to CPLR 4404 (a) for a directed verdict or, in the alternative, for a new trial, unanimously
affirmed.

Defendant's motion for a directed verdict was properly denied. The jury could
rationally conclude that defendant had constructive notice of the alleged defect and that
the defect was not trivial from plaintiff's testimony that she tripped on a "drop" between
the sidewalk and the courtyard on defendant's premises and from the photographs of the
defect submitted into evidence (see Simmons v New York City Tr. Auth., 110 AD3d 625,
625 [1st Dept 2013]). In addition, the testimony from plaintiff and her expert permitted
the jury to reasonably conclude that the subject accident, and not a pre-existing
condition, was the cause of the meniscus tear in plaintiff's left knee (see Cohen v
Hallmark Cards, 45 NY2d 493, 499 [1978]). We note that although defendant failed
to submit the transcript of plaintiff's expert's testimony with its motion to set a side the
verdict pursuant to CPLR 4404 (a), we have taken judicial notice of it (Santos v National Retail Transp.,
Inc., 87 AD3d 418 [1st Dept 2011]).

Plaintiff's motion in limine to preclude defendant from submitting evidence of her
other health conditions was properly granted since the conditions are not relevant to the
treatment of her knee injury. In any event, defendant's counsel was permitted to question
plaintiff and her treating physician at length about these other health conditions,
rendering harmless any alleged error in its exclusion (see Ateser v Becker, 272
AD2d 219 [1st Dept 2000], lv denied 95 NY2d [*2]762 [2000]). To the extent defendant argues that the
medical conditions are relevant to damages for future loss of enjoyment of life, it does
not seek to vacate that portion of the jury award.

Defendant did not preserve its argument that the trial court abused its discretion in
permitting plaintiff's counsel to cross-examine defendant's expert on collateral issues,
including a prior medical malpractice claim brought against him, and his testimony in
unrelated trials that the meniscus tears sustained by those plaintiffs were degenerative
and not traumatic in nature. Defendant either failed to object to the line of questioning or
objected on grounds that differ from those it raises on appeal (see CPLR 5501 [a]
[3]; Griffin v Clinton Green S.,
LLC, 98 AD3d 41, 47 [1st Dept 2012]).

Although the award of $25,000 for past medical expenses is supported by the
evidence, the award of $100,000 for future medical damages is excessive, given
plaintiff's treating physician's testimony that her future left knee replacement surgery and
associated costs will amount to $50,000-$60,000 (see Brewster v Prince Apts.,
264 AD2d 611, 617 [1st Dept 1999], lv dismissed 94 NY2d 875 [2000], lv
denied 94 NY2d 762 [2000]). Defendant's claim that the jury rushed to judgment and
did not give the case due deliberation is speculative and unsubstantiated.
