Appellants.

Dechert LLP, New York (Benjamin E. Rosenberg of counsel), for appellants.

Motta & Krents, New York (Anthony Motta of counsel), for respondent.

Cowan, Liebowitz & Latman, P.C., New York (Thomas Kjellberg of counsel), for
amicus curiae.



Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Saliann Scarpulla, J.), entered on or about
September 20, 2013, which, to the extent appealed from, granted plaintiff's cross motion
to amend its complaint to add a claim for breach of contract as a third-party beneficiary
as against defendant Sony Music Holdings, Inc., unanimously reversed, on the law,
without costs, the cross motion denied, and the complaint dismissed. The Clerk is
directed to enter judgment accordingly.

Plaintiff cannot assert a claim as a third-party beneficiary of a letter agreement
between defendants Moore and Sony. The agreement, requesting and authorizing Sony to
deduct a portion of royalties payable to Moore and to pay them directly to plaintiff, by its
express terms, [*2]negates any intent to permit
enforcement by third parties (see Mendel v Henry Phipps Plaza W., Inc., 6 NY3d 783,
786 [2006]; Board of Mgrs. of Alexandria Condominium v Broadway/72nd
Assoc., 285 AD2d 422, 424 [1st Dept 2001]). Concur—Tom, J.P., Friedman,
Acosta, Andrias and Richter, JJ. [Prior Case History: 2013 NY Slip Op
