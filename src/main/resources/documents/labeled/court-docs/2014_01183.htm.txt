	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Ollie Dolson, Appellant.


—[*1]


Richard L. Herzfeld, New York, N.Y., for appellant.

David M. Hoovler, District Attorney, Middletown, N.Y. (Andrew R. Kass of
counsel), for respondent.


Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Orange County
(Freehill, J.), rendered November 20, 2012, as amended November 20, 2012, convicting
him of robbery in the first degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.
Assigned counsel has submitted a brief in accordance with Anders v California
(386 US 738 [1967]), in which he moves for leave to withdraw as counsel for the
appellant.

Ordered that the judgment, as amended, is affirmed.

We are satisfied with the sufficiency of the brief filed by the defendant's assigned
counsel pursuant to Anders v California (386 US 738 [1967]), and, upon an
independent review of the record, we conclude that there are no nonfrivolous issues
which could be raised on appeal. Counsel's application for leave to withdraw as counsel
is, therefore, granted (see Anders v California, 386 US 738 [1967]; Matter of Giovanni S. [Jasmin
A.], 89 AD3d 252 [2011]; People v Paige, 54 AD2d 631 [1976];
cf. People v Gonzalez, 47 NY2d 606 [1979]). Skelos, J.P., Dickerson,
Chambers and Miller, JJ., concur.
