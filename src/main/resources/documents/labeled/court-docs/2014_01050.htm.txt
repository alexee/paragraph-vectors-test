	In the Matter of John Reilly, Appellant,
v
City of
Rome et al., Respondents.


—[*1]



Felt Evans, LLP, Clinton (Jay G. Williams, III, of Counsel), for
petitioner-appellant.

Cohen & Cohen LLP, Utica (Richard A. Cohen of Counsel), for
respondents-respondents.



Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Oneida County (Norman I. Siegel, J.),
entered June 13, 2012 in a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78. The order granted
respondents' motion to vacate a default judgment.

It is hereby ordered that the order so appealed from is unanimously affirmed without
costs.

Memorandum: In this proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78, petitioner appeals
from an order granting respondents' motion to vacate a default judgment. We note at the
outset that, although no appeal as of right lies from an intermediate order in a CPLR
article 78 proceeding (see CPLR 5701 [b] [1]), we treat the notice of appeal as an
application for leave to appeal from the order and grant the application (see Matter of
Conde v Aiello, 204 AD2d 1029, 1029 [1994]). It is well settled that the decision
whether to vacate a default judgment is a matter within Supreme Court's discretion
(see Alliance Prop. Mgt. & Dev. v Andrews Ave. Equities, 70 NY2d 831,
832-833 [1987]). Here, given that respondents proffered a reasonable excuse for failing
to serve a timely answer to the petition and demonstrated a meritorious defense
(see CPLR 5015 [a] [1]; Puchner v Nastke, 91 AD3d 1261, 1261-1262 [2012]), and
considering the "strong public policy in favor of resolving cases on the merits" (Moore v Day, 55 AD3d
803, 804 [2008]; see Puchner, 91 AD3d at 1262), we conclude that the court
did not abuse its discretion in granting respondents' motion (see Cavagnaro v Frontier Cent.
School Dist., 17 AD3d 1099, 1099 [2005]). We note that, prior to the default,
respondents engaged in settlement discussions with petitioner and filed a motion to
dismiss the petition, thus evidencing a "good faith intent to defend" the proceeding on
the merits (Coven v Trust Co. of N.J., 225 AD2d 576, 576 [1996]), and we
further note that petitioner was not prejudiced by the slight delay in answering the
petition (see Accetta v
Simmons, 108 AD3d 1096, 1097 [2013]). Present—Smith, J.P.,
Peradotto, Lindley, Valentino and Whalen, JJ.
