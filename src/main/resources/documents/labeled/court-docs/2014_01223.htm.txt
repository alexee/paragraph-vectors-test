Egan Jr., J. Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court (Campbell, J.), entered
October 12, 2012 in Cortland County, which, among other things, dismissed petitioner's
application, in a proceeding pursuant to Family Ct Act article 6, to modify a prior order
of custody.

Petitioner (hereinafter the father) and respondent (hereinafter the mother) are the
parents of three children, the youngest of whom (born in 2002) is the subject of this
proceeding. In August 2011, the parties entered into an open court stipulation, which
subsequently was incorporated into their December 2011 judgment of divorce, providing
for joint custody of the subject child with essentially equal parenting time. In October
2011, the mother became embroiled in a physical altercation with her boyfriend and, in
the process of removing herself from that situation, was arrested for driving while
intoxicated. Although the child was not present for this incident, a child protective
services report was indicated against the mother for inadequate guardianship. Two
months later, the mother, who worked for a cleaning service, became severely intoxicated
while cleaning the residence of one of her clients and fell down a set of stairs. The child,
who had accompanied the mother on the day in question, managed to take the mother's
car keys away from her and called the father for help; eventually, law enforcement
officials were able to locate the child and provide assistance. As a result of this incident,
the [*2]mother was charged with endangering the welfare
of a child and another indicated report was filed against her—this time for placing
the child in imminent danger.

The father thereafter commenced a proceeding in Cortland County Family Court
seeking to modify the prior custody arrangement. The mother answered and
cross-petitioned for sole custody, and the proceedings were transferred to the IDV part of
Supreme Court. Following a hearing and an in camera interview with the child, Supreme
Court, among other things, dismissed the father's application, finding that he failed to
demonstrate a sufficient change in circumstances to warrant modification of the
agreed-upon custody arrangement. This appeal by the father ensued.

We reverse. "When parties enter into stipulations resolving custody issues, those
stipulations will not be modified unless there is a sufficient change in circumstances
since the time of the stipulation, and unless modification of the custody arrangement is in
the best interests of the child[ ]" (Mathie v Mathie, 65 AD3d 527, 529 [2009] [internal
quotation marks and citation omitted]; accord Matter of DiCiacco v DiCiacco, 89 AD3d 937, 937
[2011]; see Matter of Smith v
O'Donnell, 107 AD3d 1311, 1312-1313 [2013]; Matter of Greene v Robarge,
104 AD3d 1073, 1075 [2013]). Here, although the father admittedly was aware of
the mother's issues with alcohol at the time that he agreed to share custody with her,
evidence of the mother's continuing and escalating problems in this regard, coupled with
her subsequent alcohol-related arrests and the indicated child protective services reports,
"was sufficient to constitute a change in circumstances requiring a review of the existing
custody arrangement in order to determine whether [such arrangement] continued to be
in the child's best interests" (Matter of Martin v Mills, 94 AD3d 1364, 1366 [2012]; see Matter of Fish v Fish, 100
AD3d 1049, 1050 [2012]). Accordingly, Supreme Court should have undertaken a
best interests analysis. As the record before us is not sufficiently developed to permit us
to make an independent determination in this regard, we remit this matter to Supreme
Court for that purpose (see Matter of Martin v Mills, 94 AD3d at 1366). Upon
remittal, and in light of the length of time that has elapsed, Supreme Court may "hear
additional relevant evidentiary proof to assess the circumstances as they currently exist"
(id.).

Lahtinen, J.P., McCarthy and Rose, JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is reversed, on
the law, without costs, and matter remitted to the Supreme Court for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this Court's decision.
