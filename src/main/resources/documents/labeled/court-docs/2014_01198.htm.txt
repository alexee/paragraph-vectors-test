	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Joseph Pannettiere, Appellant.


—[*1]



Robert C. Mitchell, Riverhead, N.Y. (Alfred J. Cicale of counsel), for appellant.

Thomas J. Spota, District Attorney, Riverhead, N.Y. (Michael J. Miller of counsel),
for respondent.



Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Suffolk County
(Hudson, J.), rendered December 10, 2010, convicting him of criminal contempt in the
first degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence. Assigned counsel has
submitted a brief in accordance with Anders v California (386 US 738 [1967]),
in which he moves for leave to withdraw as counsel for the appellant.

Ordered that the motion of Robert C. Mitchell for leave to withdraw as counsel for
the appellant is granted, and he is directed to turn over all papers in his possession to the
appellant's new counsel assigned herein; and it is further,

Ordered that Mark Diamond, P.O. Box 287356, Yorkville Station, New York, N.Y.,
10128 is assigned as counsel to prosecute the appeal; and it is further,

Ordered that the respondent is directed to furnish a copy of the certified transcript of
the proceedings to the appellant's new assigned counsel; and it is further,

Ordered that new counsel shall serve and file a brief on behalf of the appellant within
90 days of the date of this decision and order on motion and the respondent shall serve
and file its brief within 30 days after the brief on behalf of the appellant is served and
filed. By prior decision and order on motion of this Court dated May 16, 2011, the
appellant was granted leave to prosecute the appeal as a poor person, with the appeal to
be heard on the original papers, including a certified transcript of the proceedings, and on
the briefs of the parties, who were directed to file nine copies of their respective briefs
and to serve one copy on each other.

The brief submitted by the appellant's counsel pursuant to Anders v
California (386 US 738 [1967]) is deficient because it fails to contain an adequate
statement of facts and fails to analyze potential appellate issues or highlight facts in the
record that might arguably support the appeal (see People v McNair, 110 AD3d 742 [2013]; People v Singleton, 101 AD3d
909, 910 [2012]; Matter of
Giovanni S. [Jasmin A.], 89 AD3d 252, 256 [2011]). The brief does not provide
any detail regarding the County Court's inquiries or the defendant's responses at the plea
proceeding, and does not identify the basis for [*2]counsel's conclusory statement that the defendant "entered a
voluntary plea of guilty" (see
People v Sedita, 113 AD3d 638 [2014]). In addition, the statement of facts does
not provide any detail regarding the defendant's factual admissions as to the crime
charged (see id.). Since the brief does not demonstrate that assigned counsel
fulfilled his obligations under Anders v California, we must assign new counsel
to represent the appellant (see
People v McNair, 110 AD3d 742 [2013]; People v Singleton, 101
AD3d at 910; Matter of Giovanni S. [Jasmin A.], 89 AD3d at 258). Mastro, J.P.,
Hall, Austin and Sgroi, JJ., concur.
