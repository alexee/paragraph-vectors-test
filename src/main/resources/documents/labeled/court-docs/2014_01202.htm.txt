	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Daryl Snyder, Appellant.


—[*1]


Lynn W.L. Fahey, New York, N.Y. (Denise A. Corsí of counsel), for
appellant.

Richard A. Brown, District Attorney, Kew Gardens, N.Y. (John M. Castellano and
Anastasia Spanakos of counsel; Lorrie A. Zinno on the brief), for respondent.


Appeal by the defendant from a second resentence of the Supreme Court, Queens
County (Hirsch, J.), imposed May 24, 2012, upon his convictions of robbery in the first
degree (three counts) and robbery in the second degree (four counts), upon a jury verdict,
the second resentence being periods of postrelease supervision in addition to the
determinate terms of imprisonment previously imposed upon his first resentence on
December 2, 2003.

Ordered that the second resentence is affirmed.

Since the defendant was still serving his first resentence when the second resentence
was imposed, the second resentence to terms including the statutorily required periods of
postrelease supervision did not subject him to double jeopardy or violate his right to due
process of law (see People v
Lingle, 16 NY3d 621, 630-633 [2011]; People v Simms, 107 AD3d 746 [2013]; People v Cooke, 94 AD3d
1138 [2012]).

The periods of postrelease supervision imposed were not excessive (see People v
Suitte, 90 AD2d 80 [1982]). Rivera, J.P., Dickerson, Cohen and Hinds-Radix, JJ.,
concur.
