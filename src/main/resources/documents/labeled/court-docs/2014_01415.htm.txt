—[*1]


Steve S. Efron, New York, for appellant.

Pollack, Pollack, Isaac & De Cicco, New York (Brian J. Isaac of counsel), for
respondent.



Judgment, Supreme Court, Bronx County (Robert E. Torres, J.), entered on or about
July 25, 2012, which, to the extent appealed from as limited by the briefs, following a
jury verdict, awarded plaintiff total compensatory damages of $2,610,000, including
$600,000 for past pain and suffering, and $1,300,000 for future pain and suffering over
27 years, unanimously modified, on the facts, to vacate the award for future pain and
suffering and remand the matter for a new trial solely on the issue of such damages
unless plaintiff, within 30 days of service of a copy of this order, with notice of entry,
stipulates to reduce the award of damages for future pain and suffering to $800,000 and
to entry of an amended judgment in accordance therewith, and otherwise affirmed,
without costs.

The jury's award is supported by testimony from plaintiff, his son, and a cleaner
employed by defendant, that debris on the stairs of the subway station was a recurring
condition, of which defendant was aware, that was left unaddressed (see Kelsey v
Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 52 AD2d 801 [1st Dept 1976]). Defendant did not
demonstrate that a reasonable cleaning schedule was established and followed prior to
plaintiff's accident, as its employee testified only that she cleaned the steps where
plaintiff fell two days before the accident, there was no evidence of additional cleaning
thereafter, and no cleaning log was admitted into evidence establishing that the routine
cleaning schedule was adhered to (see Williams v New York City Hous. Auth., 99 AD3d 613
[1st Dept 2012]; accord
Harrison v New York City Tr. Auth., 94 AD3d 512, 514 [1st Dept 2012]).
[*2]
We find that, to the extent indicated, the award
for future pain and suffering deviates materially from what is reasonable compensation
under the circumstances. Concur—Tom, J.P., Friedman, Acosta, Andrias and
Richter, JJ.
