	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Sequan Downing, Also Known as Naquan Downing,
Appellant.


—[*1]


Lynn W.L. Fahey, New York, N.Y. (Steven R. Bernhard of counsel), for
appellant.

Kenneth P. Thompson, District Attorney, Brooklyn, N.Y. (Leonard Joblove, Sholom
J. Twersky, and Arieh Schulman of counsel), for respondent.


Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County
(Gary, J.), rendered November 17, 2011, convicting him of attempted rape in the first
degree, sexual abuse in the first degree, and robbery in the third degree, upon a jury
verdict, and imposing sentence.

Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.

The defendant's challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting his
conviction of attempted rape in the first degree is unpreserved for appellate review
(see CPL 470.05 [2]; People v Hawkins, 11 NY3d 484, 492 [2008]). In any
event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the People (see People v
Contes, 60 NY2d 620, 621 [1983]), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish
the defendant's guilt of attempted rape in the first degree beyond a reasonable doubt (see People v Clyde, 18 NY3d
145 [2011]; People v Pereau, 64 NY2d 1055 [1985]; People v Jackson, 11 AD3d
369 [2004]; People v Urbina, 248 AD2d 123 [1998]). Moreover, upon our
independent review of the weight of the evidence (see CPL 470.15 [5]; People v Danielson, 9 NY3d
342 [2007]), we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt as to that crime was not against
the weight of the evidence (see
People v Romero, 7 NY3d 633 [2006]). Mastro, J.P., Cohen, Miller and
Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur.
