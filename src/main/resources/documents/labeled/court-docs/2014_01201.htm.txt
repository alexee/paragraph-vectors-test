	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Percinthe Smith, Appellant.


—[*1]


Lynn W.L. Fahey, New York, N.Y., for appellant.

Kenneth P. Thompson, District Attorney, Brooklyn, N.Y. (Leonard Joblove and
Rhea A. Grob of counsel; Gregory Musso on the brief), for respondent.


Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County
(Walsh, J.), rendered September 25, 2012, convicting him of attempted criminal
possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, upon his plea of guilty, and
imposing sentence. Assigned counsel has submitted a brief in accordance with
Anders v California (386 US 738 [1967]), in which she moves for leave to
withdraw as counsel for the appellant.

Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.

We are satisfied with the sufficiency of the brief filed by the defendant's assigned
counsel pursuant to Anders v California (386 US 738 [1967]), and, upon an
independent review of the record, we conclude that there are no nonfrivolous issues
which could be raised on appeal. Counsel's application for leave to withdraw as counsel
is, therefore, granted (see Anders v California, 386 US 738 [1967]; Matter of Giovanni S. [Jasmin
A.], 89 AD3d 252 [2011]; People v Paige, 54 AD2d 631 [1976]; cf.
People v Gonzalez, 47 NY2d 606 [1979]). Rivera, J.P., Dickerson, Cohen and
Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur.
