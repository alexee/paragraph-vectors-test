v
Surujdat Mohabir et al., Respondents, et al.,
Respondents.


—[*1]


Burke, Gordon & Conway, White Plains (Sami P. Nasser of counsel), for
appellant.

Steven Siegel, P.C., Kew Gardens (Steven Siegel of counsel), for
respondents.



Order, Supreme Court, Bronx County (Sharon A.M. Aarons, J.), entered November
1, 2012, which, upon renewal, granted the motion of respondents Surujdat Mohabir and
Khamni Mohabir to vacate a prior order of the same court and Justice, entered on or
about July 20, 2011, which permanently stayed the subject arbitration, unanimously
reversed, on the law, without costs, the motion denied, and the order entered on or about
July 20, 2011, reinstated.

The Mohabirs' vehicle, insured by petitioner Liberty Mutual Insurance Company
(Liberty), was struck by a truck that left the scene of the accident. On July 12, 2007 and
July 31, 2007, the Mohabirs sent Liberty a request for arbitration dated July 11, 2007,
which Liberty received on July 13, 2007 and August 1, 2007, respectively. By petition
dated August 20, 2007, Liberty moved to permanently stay the arbitration, asserting,
among other things, that the offending vehicle had a policy of insurance with respondent
Progressive Insurance, and was owned and driven by additional respondent Harbhajan
Singh.

By order entered December 12, 2007, Supreme Court denied the petition, without
prejudice, on the ground that the evidence supporting the claim was too sparse. Petitioner
again sought a stay and by order entered March 6, 2008, the court, finding sufficient
evidence to make out a prima facie case, stayed the arbitration pending a framed issue
hearing to determine all issues of insurance coverage. By order entered July 23, 2008, the
court granted petitioner's motion for leave to reargue, and upon reargument, adhered to
its prior determination. Progressive and Singh appealed and this Court affirmed (68
AD3d 435 [1st Dept 2009]).

The framed issue hearing was held on June 13, 2011. By order entered July 20, 2011,
the court ordered that Singh be added as a respondent and permanently stayed the
arbitration. The order was allegedly served with notice of entry on February 6, 2012. On
April 19, 2012, the Mohabirs moved by order to show cause to vacate the July 20, 2011
order pursuant to CPLR 5015 (a) (4), arguing for the first time that Supreme Court
lacked jurisdiction to stay the arbitration because the petition was untimely pursuant to
CPLR 7503 (c) since it was filed more than 20 days after Liberty had received the first
arbitration demand.
[*2]
Supreme Court erred when it granted the
Mohabirs' motion, which it deemed a motion for leave to renew, and upon renewal,
vacated the July 20, 2011 order and dismissed the petition to stay arbitration, on the
grounds that it was untimely.

"The 20-day time limit of CPLR 7503 is construed as a period of limitation, and the
courts have no discretion to waive or extend the statutory period" (Matter of Hartford Ins. Co.
[Martin], 16 AD3d 149, 150 [1st Dept 2005]; see Aetna Life & Cas. Co. v
Stekardis, 34 NY2d 182, 185-186 [1974]). However, "[a] Statute of Limitations
defense is waivable [by a party], and failure to raise it does not deprive the court of
jurisdiction" (Mendez v Steen Trucking, 254 AD2d 715, 716 [4th Dept 1998]).

Under the particular circumstances of this case, respondents waived their statute of
limitations defense when, after serving the request for arbitration a second time on July
31, 2007, they participated in the litigation for five years, during which time they failed
to raise the CPLR 7503 (c) defense in their opposition to petitioner's applications for a
stay, in the prior appeal in which this Court ordered a framed issue hearing on coverage
issues, or at the framed issue hearing itself (see Miraglia v H & L Holding Corp., 67 AD3d 513, 515
[1st Dept 2009], lv dismissed in part, denied in part 14 NY3d 766 [2010]
["Waiver of an argument will be recognized where, as here, the court had jurisdiction of
the general subject matter but a contention is made after judgment that the court did not
have power to act in the particular case or as to a particular question in the case" (internal
quotation marks omitted)]; see
also Measom v Greenwich & Perry St. Hous. Corp., 42 AD3d 366 [1st Dept
2007], lv dismissed 9 NY3d 946 [2007]).

In Measom, this Court, on a prior appeal, ruled that an apartment was not
legally habitable for residential purposes and remanded the matter for a trial on damages.
On a subsequent appeal, the defendant attempted to assert, for the first time, the
affirmative defense of statute of limitations. This Court held that "[t]he affirmative
defense of the statute of limitations was abandoned by defendant since it failed to raise it
as an alternative ground for affirmance on the prior appeal when it was germane to this
Court's determination" (id. at 366; see also Dimery v Ulster Sav. Bank, 13 AD3d 574 [2d
Dept 2004], lv denied 5 NY3d 706 [2005], cert denied 547 US 1097
[2006]).

The Mohibirs' counsel's explanation that the failure to request dismissal of the
petition earlier was inadvertent is unavailing. Counsel claims that he was unaware that a
new legal secretary had served the first request for arbitration until he was in the process
of reviewing the file in connection with a planned appeal of the July 20, 2011 order.
However, counsel does not provide a reasonable explanation as to why the demand was
not discovered while reviewing the file in connection with the prior motion practice or
his preparation for the prior appeal or the framed issue hearing.
[*3]
Accordingly, the order entered on or about July
20, 2011, which permanently stayed the subject arbitration after the framed issue hearing,
should be reinstated. Concur—Acosta, J.P., Andrias, Saxe, Freedman and
Feinman, JJ.
