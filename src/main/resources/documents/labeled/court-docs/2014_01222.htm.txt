v
Andrew D., Appellant.


—[*1]



Cynthia Feathers, Glens Falls, for appellant.

Eric T. Schneiderman, Attorney General, Albany (Kathleen Treasure of counsel), for
respondent.



Lahtinen, J.P. Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court (Nolan Jr., J.), entered
October 4, 2012 in Saratoga County, which granted petitioner's application, in a
proceeding pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law article 10, to find respondent to be a
dangerous sex offender and confined him to a secure treatment facility.

Respondent's history of repeatedly sexually abusing female children is set forth in
our earlier decision (Matter of
State of New York v Andrew O., 68 AD3d 1161, 1162 [2009], revd 16 NY3d 841
[2011]). That case was reversed because of the prejudicial cross-examination of
respondent's expert regarding the expert's religious beliefs and remanded for a new trial
(Matter of State of New York v Andrew O., 16 NY3d 841, 844 [2011]). On
remand, respondent waived his right to a jury trial and consented to a finding that he
suffers from a mental abnormality. A dispositional hearing ensued, after which Supreme
Court rendered a written decision finding that respondent was a dangerous sex offender
requiring confinement. Respondent appeals, contending that the record lacks adequate
proof that he is a dangerous sex offender and that, instead, he should have been released
into the community under strict and intensive supervision and treatment (hereinafter
SIST).

Where, as here, a finding of mental abnormality has been made, "then the court shall
consider whether the respondent is a dangerous sex offender requiring confinement or a
sex offender requiring [SIST]" (Mental Hygiene Law § 10.07 [f]; see Matter of State of New York v
[*2]Nelson D., 22 NY3d 233, 238-239 [2013]).
Establishing that confinement is appropriate requires petitioner to present "clear and
convincing evidence that the respondent has a mental abnormality involving such a
strong predisposition to commit sex offenses, and such an inability to control behavior,
that the respondent is likely to be a danger to others and to commit sex offenses if not
confined" (Mental Hygiene Law § 10.07 [f]; see Matter of State of New York v Steur, 102 AD3d 481,
481 [2013]; Matter of State of
New York v Walter W., 94 AD3d 1177, 1178 [2012], lv denied 19
NY3d 810 [2012]). Where conflicting expert testimony and other credibility issues are
presented at the hearing, we accord deference to the trial court's assessment of credibility
since it is best positioned to make those determinations (see Matter of State of New York v
Lonard ZZ., 100 AD3d 1279, 1281 [2012]; Matter of State of New York v Timothy EE., 97 AD3d
996, 998 [2012]; Matter of State of New York v Walter W., 94 AD3d at
1180).

Petitioner's proof included testimony by psychologist Christine Rackley, who had
evaluated respondent in August 2007 and again in February 2012. Rackley opined that
respondent was a dangerous sex offender requiring confinement. She testified about
many factors influencing her opinion, including respondent's tendency to blame his
victims or their mothers for his behavior, his remaining reticence to disclose the scope of
his offenses thereby undermining his treatment, his difficulty in controlling anger
together with poor judgment and poor response to stress, and his lack of empathy for his
victims and indication that they wanted to be victimized. She believed that his antisocial
orientation, in combination with his ongoing sexual deviance, created a great risk of
recidivism. Rackley acknowledged that respondent's arousal levels were not significant
when exposed to images of prepubescent girls during a penile plethysmograph, but
explained that the test results also reflected that he was actively suppressing arousal. She
further stated that, although respondent's STATIC scores for reoffending were not high,
she believed he fell within those low scorers who were nonetheless likely to reoffend.
This opinion was based in part on the fact that he had previously reoffended while on
probation and, when on parole, had moved quickly to establish a relationship with a
woman who had a young daughter. In addition to his actions, he had reportedly also
expressed a strong aversion to supervision, and Rackley concluded that he would be very
difficult to supervise in the community.

Although respondent's expert opined that petitioner could be placed in SIST,
Supreme Court found that he had replaced objectivity with advocacy in his analysis. The
court concluded that he had not adequately identified and credibly assessed reoffending
factors. Respondent's testimony was determined by Supreme Court to lack credibility on
crucial matters and his other proof was unpersuasive to the court. While there was an
indication of recent improvement by respondent, petitioner nonetheless presented
sufficient proof—which Supreme Court found credible—demonstrating that
respondent remained a dangerous sex offender requiring confinement. After
independently reviewing all the evidence in the record, while according deference to
Supreme Court's assessment of credibility, we are unpersuaded to set aside Supreme
Court's determination (see
generally Matter of Sincere KK. v State of New York, 111 AD3d 1083, 1085
[2013]; Matter of State of New York v Lonard ZZ., 100 AD3d at 1281).

Stein, McCarthy and Egan Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is affirmed, without
costs.
