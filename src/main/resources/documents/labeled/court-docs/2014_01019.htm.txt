	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Christopher Joseph, Appellant.


—[*1]


Lynn W.L. Fahey, New York, N.Y., for appellant.

Kenneth P. Thompson, District Attorney, Brooklyn, N.Y. (Leonard Joblove and
Linda Breen of counsel), for respondent.


Appeal by the defendant, as limited by his motion, from a sentence of the Supreme
Court, Kings County (DiMango, J.), imposed October 2, 2012, upon his plea of guilty,
on the ground that the sentence was excessive.

Ordered that the sentence is affirmed.

The defendant's purported waiver of his right to appeal was invalid (see People v Bradshaw, 18
NY3d 257, 265 [2011]; People v DeSimone, 80 NY2d 273, 283 [1992])
and, thus, does not preclude review of his excessive sentence claim. However, the
sentence imposed was not excessive (see People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80 [1982]).
Eng, P.J., Skelos, Leventhal and Sgroi, JJ., concur.
