—[*1]


Center for Appellate Litigation, New York (Robert S. Dean of counsel), for
appellant.

Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., District Attorney, New York (Christopher P. Marinelli of
counsel), for respondent.



Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Renee A. White, J.), rendered
February 29, 2012, convicting defendant, upon her plea of guilty, of criminal possession
of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, and sentencing her to a term of 2½
years, unanimously affirmed.

Under the particular circumstances of the case, the court properly exercised its
discretion when it declined to adjourn the sentencing, which had already been adjourned
twice, for the purpose of having defendant's retained attorney of record appear instead of
his law partner. The partner had actually represented defendant for most purposes,
including the Supreme Court arraignment, the plea negotiations, and the plea
proceedings, and he was plainly familiar with the case. The only issue that arose at
sentencing was whether defendant's postplea conduct had disqualified her for a more
lenient disposition than the agreed-upon sentence. The partner capably represented
defendant in this regard, and the court properly concluded that defendant had violated the
conditions of her plea. The prison sentence to be imposed in the event that defendant
violated these conditions had been negotiated, and neither the partner nor the attorney of
record would have had any reason or basis for requesting further leniency (see People v Guerrero, 27
AD3d 386, 387 [1st Dept 2006]).

Defendant nevertheless asserts that the court's denial of an adjournment deprived her
of effective assistance of counsel. She alleges that the partner was inadequately prepared
for the sentencing proceeding and that the attorney of record had additional relevant
information. These claims are unreviewable on direct appeal because they involve
matters not reflected in the record (see People v Krasnovsky, 45 AD3d 446 [1st Dept 2007],
lv denied 10 NY3d 767 [2008]). Accordingly, since defendant has not made a
CPL 440.10 motion, the merits of these claims may not be addressed on appeal. In the
alternative, to the extent the existing record permits review, we find that defendant
received effective assistance under the state and federal standards (see
People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 713-714 [1998]; Strickland v
Washington, 466 US 668 [1984]).

We perceive no basis for reducing the sentence. Concur—Mazzarelli, J.P.,
Andrias, DeGrasse and Clark, JJ.
