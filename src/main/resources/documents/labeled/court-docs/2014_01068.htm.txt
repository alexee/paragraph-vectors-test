Hoffman, Respondent.


—[*1]


Wagner & Hart, LLP, Olean (Janine Fodor of counsel), for petitioner-appellant.

Wendy G. Peterson, Attorney for the Children, Olean.



Appeal from an order of the Family Court, Cattaraugus County (Michael L. Nenno,
J.), entered January 4, 2013 in a proceeding pursuant to Family Court Act article 6. The
order dismissed the petition.

It is hereby ordered that said appeal insofar as it concerns the parties' older child is
unanimously dismissed, the order is reversed on the law without costs, the petition is
reinstated and the matter is remitted to Family Court, Cattaraugus County, for further
proceedings in accordance with the following.

Memorandum: Petitioner mother appeals from an order dismissing her petition to
modify an existing custody order without a hearing. We note at the outset that the appeal
is moot with respect to the parties' older child because he reached the age of 18 years
during the pendency of this appeal (see Matter of Woodruff v Adside, 26 AD3d 866, 866
[2006]). We agree with petitioner that she was denied the right to counsel when Family
Court sua sponte dismissed her petition in the absence of her attorney. "The deprivation
of a party's fundamental right to counsel in a custody or visitation proceeding is a denial
of due process and requires reversal, without regard to the merits of the unrepresented
party's position" (Matter of
Williams v Bentley, 26 AD3d 441, 442 [2006]; see Family Ct Act
§ 262 [a]; Matter of
Dolson v Mitts, 99 AD3d 1079, 1080 [2012]; Matter of Scala v Tefft, 42
AD3d 689, 691-692 [2007]). We therefore reverse the order, reinstate the petition
and remit the matter to Family Court for further proceedings on the petition. In light of
our determination, we need not address petitioner's remaining contention.
Present—Smith, J.P., Fahey, Carni, Valentino and Whalen, JJ.
