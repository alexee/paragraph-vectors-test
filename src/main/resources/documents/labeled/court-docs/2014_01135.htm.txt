Respondent,
v
Dwayne Hoke, Appellant.


—[*1]



Stanley Neustadter, Cardozo Criminal Appeals Clinic, New York (Nathaniel S.
Boyer of counsel), for appellant.

Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., District Attorney, New York (Manu K. Balachandran of
counsel), for respondent.


Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Ruth Pickholz, J.), rendered June 1,
2011, as amended June 27, 2011, convicting defendant, after a jury trial, of six counts of
robbery in the first degree, two counts of robbery in the second degree and two counts of
criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, and sentencing him to an
aggregate term of five years, unanimously affirmed.

Defendant only challenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting the
weapon counts, which relate to a loaded revolver recovered from a codefendant. At trial,
defendant made a general claim of lack of proof that he acted in concert with the
codefendant. However, this did not preserve his specific appellate claim that proof of his
accessorial liability for the robbery did not establish his possession of the weapon
wielded during that crime by the codefendant, and we decline to review it in the interest
of justice.

As an alternative holding, we reject that claim on the merits. Defendant does not
dispute the sufficiency of the evidence that he took part in a robbery in which he and the
codefendant both displayed what appeared to be firearms. The jury could have
reasonably concluded that defendant was a joint possessor of the loaded revolver
recovered from the codefendant immediately after the crime, which was an
instrumentality of their joint criminal enterprise (see [*2]Matter of Kadeem W., 5
NY3d 864 [2005]; People v
Ramos, 59 AD3d 269 [1st Dept 2009], lv denied 12 NY3d 858 [2009];
