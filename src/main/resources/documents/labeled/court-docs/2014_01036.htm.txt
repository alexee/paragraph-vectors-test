Respondent,
v
Clemon Jones, Also Known as Clement Jones, Also Known as
Clemont Jones, Appellant. (Appeal No. 1.)


—[*1]



D.J. & J.A. Cirando, Esqs., Syracuse (Bradley E. Keem of counsel), for
defendant-appellant.

Clemon Jones, defendant-appellant pro se.

Sandra Doorley, District Attorney, Rochester (Matthew Dunham of counsel), for
respondent.



Appeal from a judgment of the Monroe County Court (Richard A. Keenan, J.),
rendered September 4, 2007. The judgment convicted defendant, upon a jury verdict, of
criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree (two counts).

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.

Memorandum: In appeal No. 1, defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him
upon a jury verdict of two counts of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the
second degree (Penal Law § 170.25) and, in appeal No. 2, he appeals from a
judgment convicting him upon his plea of guilty of criminal possession of a forged
instrument in the first degree (Penal Law § 170.30). With respect to appeal No. 1,
defendant correctly concedes that he failed to preserve for our review his challenge to the
legal sufficiency of the evidence inasmuch as he made only a general motion for a trial
order of dismissal (see People v Gray, 86 NY2d 10, 19 [1995]). In any event, that
contention lacks merit (see generally People v Bleakley, 69 NY2d 490, 495
[1987]). Viewing the evidence in light of the elements of the crimes as charged to the
jury (see People v
Danielson, 9 NY3d 342, 349 [2007]), we further conclude that the verdict is not
against the weight of the evidence (see generally Bleakley, 69 NY2d at 495). The
evidence presented at trial, which included recorded conversations between defendant
and an undercover officer, supported the jury's rejection of the affirmative defense of
entrapment (see People v
Gordon, 72 AD3d 841, 842 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 920 [2010];
People v White, 272 AD2d 872, 872 [2000], lv denied 95 NY2d 859
[2000]).

Defendant failed to preserve for our review his further contention in appeal No. 1
that the police conduct deprived him of due process and, in any event, that contention is
without merit (see People v
Din, 62 AD3d 1023, 1024 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 795 [2009]).
Contrary to the further contention of defendant, County Court did not abuse its discretion
in refusing to assign him new counsel. The record establishes that the court made the
requisite " 'minimal inquiry' " into defendant's reasons for requesting new counsel (People v Porto, 16 NY3d
93, 100 [2010]; see People
v Adger, 83 AD3d 1590, 1591-1592 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 857
[2011]), and defendant " 'did not establish a serious complaint concerning defense
counsel's representation and thus did not suggest a serious possibility of good cause for
substitution [of counsel]' " (Adger, 83 AD3d at 1591; see People v Ayuso, 80 AD3d
708, 708-709 [2011], lv denied 16 NY3d 856 [2011]). Defendant's problems
with defense counsel resulted from "strategic disagreements . . . and from
an antagonistic attitude on defendant's part," neither of which requires substitution of
counsel (People v
Sturdevant, 74 AD3d 1491, 1494 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 810
[2010]). We note that the court granted defendant's previous request for new counsel,
and it is well settled that " '[t]he right of an indigent criminal defendant to the services of
a court-appointed lawyer does not encompass a right to appointment of successive
lawyers at defendant's option' " (People v Ward, 27 AD3d 1119, 1120 [2006], lv denied
7 NY3d 819 [2006], reconsideration denied 7 NY3d 871 [2006], quoting
People v Sides, 75 NY2d 822, 824 [1990]).

Also with respect to appeal No. 1, we reject the contention of defendant in his main
and pro se supplemental briefs that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The
record does not support defendant's contention in his main brief that communication
issues hindered the defense. Even assuming, arguendo, that defense counsel's prior
representation of a codefendant of the confidential informant in an unrelated case
constitutes a potential conflict of interest, we conclude that defendant has not
demonstrated that "the alleged conflict operated upon his defense in any way" (People v Monette, 70 AD3d
1186, 1188 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 776 [2010]). Contrary to defendant's
contention in his pro se supplemental brief, defense counsel's failure to object to a single
allegedly improper remark during the prosecutor's summation does not render him
ineffective (see People v
Ward, 107 AD3d 1605, 1607 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1078 [2013]).
Rather, "[v]iewing the evidence, the law and the circumstances of this case, in totality
and as of the time of representation," we conclude that defendant was not denied
effective assistance of counsel (People v Goossens, 92 AD3d 1281, 1282 [2012], lv
denied 19 NY3d 960 [2012]; see generally People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137,
147 [1981]).

Defendant further contends in his main brief that he was deprived of a fair trial by
prosecutorial misconduct on summation. Defendant failed to preserve his contention for
our review with respect to one of the two challenged remarks inasmuch as he did not
object to that remark at trial (see Ward, 107 AD3d at 1606; People v Foster, 101 AD3d
1668, 1670 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1098 [2013]). In any event, we
conclude that "[a]ny 'improprieties were not so pervasive or egregious as to deprive
defendant of a fair trial' " (People v Johnson, 303 AD2d 967, 968 [2003], lv
denied 100 NY2d 583 [2003]). As defendant correctly concedes, he likewise failed
to preserve for our review his contention that he was improperly shackled during the
persistent felony offender hearing (see People v Robinson, 49 AD3d 1269, 1270 [2008], lv
denied 10 NY3d 869 [2008]), and we decline to exercise our power to review that
contention as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [6]
[a]).

The contention of defendant concerning appeal No. 1 in his main and pro se
supplemental briefs that he was improperly adjudicated a persistent felony offender was
considered and rejected by this Court on defendant's appeal from an order denying his
CPL article 440 motion to vacate the sentence imposed upon the underlying judgment of
conviction (People v Jones,
109 AD3d 1108, 1108 [2013]). Defendant's further contention in his pro se
supplemental brief that the persistent felony offender statute is unconstitutional is
unpreserved for our review (see People v Besser, 96 NY2d 136, 148 [2001]), and
without merit in any event (see
People v Quinones, 12 NY3d 116, 119 [2009], cert denied 558 US 821
[2009]; People v Coleman,
82 AD3d 1593, 1594 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 793 [2011]).

We have reviewed defendant's remaining contentions in his pro se supplemental brief
concerning appeal No. 1 and conclude that none warrants reversal or modification.

With respect to appeal No. 2, defendant contends in his main brief that he did not
knowingly, voluntarily, or intelligently enter his Alford plea and that the People
failed to provide strong evidence of guilt. As defendant correctly concedes, he failed to
preserve those contentions for our review inasmuch as he did not move to withdraw the
plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see People v Hinkle, 56 AD3d 1210, 1210 [2008]).
Contrary to defendant's contention, this case does not fall within the narrow exception to
the preservation requirement set forth in People v Lopez (71 NY2d 662, 666
[1988]) and, in any event, we conclude that the record establishes that defendant's
Alford plea was "the product of a voluntary and rational choice," and that the
record "contains strong evidence of actual guilt" (People v Dash, 74 AD3d 1859, 1860 [2010], lv
denied 15 NY3d 892 [2010] [internal quotation marks omitted]; see People v Cruz, 89 AD3d
1464, 1465 [2011], lv denied  18 NY3d 993 [2012]).

Finally, defendant's contention in appeal No. 2 that the court should have corrected
unspecified errors in the presentence report (PSR) or, alternatively, that the court should
have conducted a hearing to determine the merits of defendant's allegations concerning
the alleged errors is unpreserved for our review inasmuch as he did not request such
relief from the court (see People
v Gibbons, 101 AD3d 1615, 1616 [2012]; see generally CPL 470.05
[2]). Indeed, the record establishes that defense counsel provided the court with certain
objections to the PSR and requested that the court append those objections to the PSR.
The court agreed to do so, and defense counsel responded that such relief "comports with
our request." Present—Scudder, P.J., Fahey, Peradotto, Carni and Valentino, JJ.
