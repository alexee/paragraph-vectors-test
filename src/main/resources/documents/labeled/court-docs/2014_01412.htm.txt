Order, Supreme Court, Bronx County (Stanley Green, J.), entered on or about April
24, 2013, which granted plaintiff's motion to restore her case to the trial calendar,
unanimously affirmed, without costs.

This medical malpractice action, alleging that defendants failed to properly treat an
injury plaintiff sustained to her right arm in 2001, was struck from the pretrial calendar in
February 2010. While plaintiff's initial motion to restore the action to the trial calendar
was denied in March 2011, the court continued conferencing the remaining discovery
issues until, upon defendants' refusal to stipulate, it instructed plaintiff to make her
follow-up motion to restore, in June 2012. Since there was no abandonment of the action,
Supreme Court properly granted plaintiff's motion to restore. Concur—Acosta,
J.P., Andrias, Saxe, Freedman and Feinman, JJ.
