	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Edwin Ortiz-Colon, Appellant.


—[*1]


Robert C. Mitchell, Riverhead, N.Y. (James H. Miller III of counsel), for
appellant.

Thomas J. Spota, District Attorney, Riverhead, N.Y. (Michael J. Miller of counsel),
for respondent.


Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Suffolk County
(Weber, J.), rendered February 1, 2011, convicting him of grand larceny in the fourth
degree and misdemeanor driving while intoxicated, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing
sentence. Assigned counsel has submitted a brief in accordance with Anders v
California (386 US 738 [1967]), in which he moves for leave to withdraw as counsel
for the appellant.

Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.

We are satisfied with the sufficiency of the brief filed by the defendant's assigned
counsel pursuant to Anders v California (386 US 738 [1967]), and, upon an
independent review of the record, we conclude that there are no nonfrivolous issues
which could be raised on the appeal. Counsel's application for leave to withdraw as
counsel is, therefore, granted (see Anders v California, 386 US 738 [1967]; Matter of Giovanni S. [Jasmin
A.], 89 AD3d 252 [2011]; People v Paige, 54 AD2d 631 [1976];
cf. People v Gonzalez, 47 NY2d 606 [1979]; People v Sedita, 113 AD3d
638 [2014]). Mastro, J.P., Hall, Austin and Sgroi, JJ., concur.
