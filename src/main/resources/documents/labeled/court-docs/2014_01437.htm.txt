—[*1]



Sim & Record, LLP, Bayside, N.Y. (Sang J. Sim of counsel), for appellant.

James G. Bilello, Westbury N.Y. (Patricia McDonagh of counsel), for
respondent.



In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, the plaintiff appeals from an
order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Bayne, J.), dated May 17, 2013, which
granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the
ground that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance
Law § 5102 (d) as a result of the subject accident.

Ordered that the order is reversed, on the law, with costs, and the defendant's motion
for summary judgment dismissing the complaint is denied.

The defendant failed to meet her prima facie burden of showing that the plaintiff did
not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law § 5102 (d) as a
result of the subject accident (see Toure v Avis Rent A Car Sys., 98 NY2d 345
[2002]; Gaddy v Eyler, 79 NY2d 955, 956-957 [1992]). The papers submitted by
the defendant failed to adequately address the plaintiff's claim, set forth in the bill of
particulars, that he sustained a serious injury under the 90/180-day category of Insurance
Law § 5102 (d) (see Che
Hong Kim v Kossoff, 90 AD3d 969 [2011]).

Since the defendant did not sustain her prima facie burden, it is unnecessary to
determine whether the papers submitted by the plaintiff in opposition were sufficient to
raise a triable issue of fact (see id.).

Accordingly, the Supreme Court should have denied the defendant's motion for
summary judgment. Rivera, J.P., Dickerson, Cohen, Hinds-Radix and Maltese, JJ.,
concur.
