v
Cheyenne J. Russaw, Jr., Appellant.


—[*1]



Erickson Webb Scolton & Hajdu, Lakewood (Lyle T. Hajdu of counsel), for
defendant-appellant.

Joseph V. Cardone, District Attorney, Albion (Katherine Bogan of counsel), for
respondent.



Appeal from a judgment of the Orleans County Court (James P. Punch, J.), rendered
October 17, 2011. The judgment convicted defendant, upon a jury verdict, of criminal
possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.

Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon a jury
verdict of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree (Penal Law
§ 220.09 [1]). Defendant failed to preserve for our review his contention that
County Court committed several errors in allowing the jurors to take notes and in
instructing the jurors with respect to note-taking, and we decline to exercise our power to
review that contention as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice (see People v Green, 35 AD3d
1197, 1198 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 922 [2007]; People v
Valiente, 309 AD2d 562, 562 [2003], lv denied 1 NY3d 602 [2004]).
Contrary to defendant's further contention, the evidence is legally sufficient to establish
that he constructively possessed the controlled substance. "Where . . . there
is no evidence that defendant actually possessed the controlled substance, the People
must establish that defendant exercised dominion or control over the property by a
sufficient level of control over the area in which the contraband [was] found or over the
person from whom the contraband [was] seized" (People v Pichardo, 34 AD3d 1223, 1224 [2006], lv
denied 8 NY3d 926 [2007] [internal quotation marks omitted]; see People v
Manini, 79 NY2d 561, 573 [1992]; see also Penal Law § 10.00 [8]).
Here, we conclude that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the People
(see People v Hines, 97 NY2d 56, 62 [2001], rearg denied 97 NY2d 678
[2001]; People v Williams, 84 NY2d 925, 926 [1994]), is legally sufficient to
establish that defendant constructively possessed the controlled substance (see
generally People v Bleakley, 69 NY2d 490, 495 [1987]). Also contrary to
defendant's contention, viewing the evidence in light of the elements of the crime as
charged to the jury (see People
v Danielson, 9 NY3d 342, 349 [2007]), the verdict is not against the weight of
the evidence (see generally Bleakley, 69 NY2d at 495).

We reject defendant's further contentions that he was denied effective assistance of
counsel (see generally People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]), and that the
sentence is unduly harsh and severe. Finally, we have reviewed defendant's remaining
contention and conclude that it does not require reversal or modification of the judgment
of conviction. Present—Scudder, P.J., Fahey, Peradotto, Lindley and Sconiers, JJ.
