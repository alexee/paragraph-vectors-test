Respondent,
v
Thomas J. DeMarco, Appellant.


—[*1]


The Legal Aid Bureau of Buffalo, Inc., Buffalo (Nicholas P. DeFonzo of
Counsel), for defendant-appellant.

Lori Pettit Rieman, District Attorney, Little Valley (Kelly M. Balcom of Counsel),
for respondent.



Appeal from a judgment of the Cattaraugus County Court (William H. Mountain, III,
A.J.), rendered November 26, 2012. The judgment convicted defendant, upon his plea of
guilty, of aggravated driving while intoxicated, a class E felony, and aggravated
unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in the second degree.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.

Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon his plea of
guilty of, inter alia, aggravated driving while intoxicated (Vehicle and Traffic Law
§§ 1192 [2-a] [a]; 1193 [1] [c] [i]). We agree with defendant that the waiver
of the right to appeal does not encompass his challenge to the severity of the sentence
because "no mention was made on the record during the course of the allocution" that he
was also waiving his right to appeal any issue concerning the severity of the sentence (People v Pimentel, 108 AD3d
861, 862 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1076 [2013]; see People v Maracle, 19
NY3d 925, 928 [2012]). We nevertheless conclude that the sentence is not unduly
harsh or severe. Present—Smith, J.P., Peradotto, Lindley, Valentino and Whalen,
JJ.
