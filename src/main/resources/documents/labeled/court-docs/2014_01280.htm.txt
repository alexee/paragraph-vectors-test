v
Ronak
Medical Care, Defendant, and Girish Patel, M.D., Appellant.


—[*1]


Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman & Dicker LLP, New York (Patrick J. Lawless
of counsel), for appellant.

The Adam Law Office, P.C., New York (Richard Adam of counsel), for
respondents.



Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Alice Schlesinger, J.), entered April 24,
2013, which, insofar as appealed from as limited by the briefs, denied the motion of
defendant Girish Patel, M.D. for summary judgment dismissing the complaint as against
him, unanimously affirmed, without costs.

In this medical malpractice action, plaintiffs allege that Dr. Patel failed to properly
treat the decedent, Julian Solano, leading to a delay in the diagnosis of his laryngeal
cancer, which condition ultimately caused his death. Dr. Patel's moving papers, including
the expert affirmation of an internist, established his entitlement to judgment as a matter
of law (see Alvarez v Prospect Hosp., 68 NY2d 320, 325 [1986]).

While an expert medical opinion is generally required to defeat a summary judgment
motion in a medical malpractice case (see e.g. Alvarez at 324), here, the
deposition testimony of the decedent's daughter was sufficient to create a triable issue of
fact. Significantly, Ms. Solano testified that, in September and/or November 2003,
approximately one year before decedent was diagnosed with cancer, she accompanied
him to visits with Dr. Patel, at which she reported that decedent's throat and ear pain
were continuing, his voice was deteriorating, he was losing weight, and that he was
bleeding at night from his mouth onto his sheets. Such testimony placed decedent's
symptoms and complaints squarely within the parameters identified by Dr. Patel's expert
as warranting referral to an otolaryngologist.

In light of the foregoing, we need not reach the issue of the admissibility and
sufficiency of the opinion of plaintiffs' expert. Were we to do so, we would find that Dr.
Patel's objections to the expert's qualifications go to the weight and not the admissibility
of her opinion (see Rojas v
Palese, 94 AD3d 557 [1st Dept 2012]; Williams-Simmons v Golden, 71 AD3d 413 [1st Dept
2010]), and that the court properly exercised its discretion by allowing plaintiffs to
correct the procedural defect caused by their submission of an affirmation from an
out-of-state physician (see CPLR 2106; Berkman Bottger & Rodd, LLP v Moriarty, 58 AD3d 539
[1st Dept 2009]; [*2]Matos v Schwartz, 104 AD3d 650, 653 [2d Dept
2013]).

We have considered Dr. Patel's remaining contentions and find them unavailing.
