Appellants.


—[*1]

Harris Beach PLLC, White Plains, N.Y. (Kristen Kelley Wilson of counsel), for
appellant City of Rye Planning Commission.

Rivkin Radler LLP, Uniondale, N.Y. (Evan H. Krinick, Cheryl F. Korman, and
Merril S. Biscone of counsel), for appellants Daniel Mathisson and Helene Mathisson.

Keane & Beane, P.C., White Plains, N.Y. (Edward F. Beane, Eric L. Gordon, and
Philip A. Butler of counsel), for respondents.



In a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 to review a determination of the City of
Rye Planning Commission dated October 11, 2011, which granted the application of
Daniel Mathisson and Helene Mathisson to modify a front yard setback line on a certain
subdivision map, the City of Rye Planning Commission appeals, and Daniel Mathisson
and Helene Mathisson separately appeal, from an order and judgment (one paper) of the
Supreme Court, Westchester County (Lorenzo, J.), dated June 4, 2012, which granted the
petitioners' motion for leave to renew and reargue the petition, and upon renewal and
reargument, vacated a prior judgment of the same court dated March 19, 2012, denying
the petition and dismissing the proceeding, and thereupon granted the petition and
annulled the determination.

Ordered that the order and judgment is reversed, on the law, the petitioners' motion
for leave to renew and reargue is denied, and the judgment dated March 19, 2012, is
reinstated, with one bill of costs to the appellants appearing separately and filing separate
briefs.

The Supreme Court should have denied that branch of the petitioners' motion which
was for leave to renew the petition, as the new evidence that the petitioners submitted in
support of that branch of their motion did not alter the analysis applicable to the petition
(see CPLR 2221 [e] [2]; see generally Kaya v B & G Holding Co., LLC, 101 AD3d
685, 687 [2012]). Moreover, the petitioners did not provide sufficient justification
for their failure to submit this new evidence with the petition (see CPLR 2221 [e]
[3]; see generally Matter of
Catherine V.D. [Rachel G.], 100 AD3d 992, 993 [2012]; Walsh v Schmigelski, 35
AD3d 849 [2006]).

The Supreme Court also should have denied that branch of the petitioners' motion
which was for leave to reargue the petition, as there is no indication that the court
misapprehended [*2]the facts or law, or mistakenly
arrived at its earlier decision (see CPLR 2221 [d] [2]; Capstone Bus. Credit, LLC v
Imperia Family Realty, LLC, 70 AD3d 882, 884 [2010]; Matter of Williams v Board of
Educ. of City School Dist. of City of N.Y., 24 AD3d 458, 459 [2005]; Daluise v Sottile, 15 AD3d
609 [2005]).

In light of our determination, we need not reach the appellants' remaining
contentions. Mastro, J.P., Cohen, Miller and Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur.
