v
City of New York
et al., Respondents.


—[*1]


Rubert & Gross, P.C., New York, N.Y. (Soledad Rubert of counsel), for
appellant.

Zachary W. Carter, Corporation Counsel, New York, N.Y. (Mordecai Newman of
counsel; Christina Chung on the brief), for respondents.



In an action, inter alia, to recover damages for false arrest, the plaintiff appeals from
an order of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Kerrigan, J.), entered April 5, 2013,
which denied his motion for leave to enter a default judgment against the defendant
Anthony Puleo and granted the cross motion of that defendant pursuant to CPLR 3012
(d) to extend his time to appear and answer and to compel the plaintiff to accept his
answer.

Ordered that the order is reversed, on the law, with costs, the plaintiff's motion for
leave to enter a default judgment against the defendant Anthony Puleo is granted, and the
cross motion of that defendant pursuant to CPLR 3012 (d) to extend his time to appear
and answer, and to compel the plaintiff to accept his answer, is denied.

In support of his cross motion pursuant to CPLR 3012 (d), the defendant Anthony
Puleo was required to provide a reasonable excuse for his default in answering or
otherwise appearing, and a potentially meritorious defense to the action (see Vigo v 501 Second St. Holding
Corp., 100 AD3d 871 [2012]; Lipp v Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 34 AD3d 649 [2006]; Juseinoski v Board of Educ. of
City of N.Y., 15 AD3d 353, 356 [2005]). However, he failed to submit an
affidavit establishing a reasonable excuse for his default or demonstrating that he had a
meritorious defense to the action. The proposed answer was insufficient to constitute an
affidavit of merit, as it was verified by an attorney who had no personal knowledge of the
facts (see Karalis v New
Dimensions HR, Inc., 105 AD3d 707, 708 [2013]; Ryan v Breezy Point Coop.,
Inc., 76 AD3d 523 [2010]). Dillon, J.P., Balkin, Leventhal and Chambers, JJ.,
concur.
