Feringa, Respondent.


—[*1]


Francisco Berry, Ithaca, for appellant.

Michael P. Graven, Owego, attorney for the child.



Egan Jr., J. Appeal from an order of the Family Court of Tioga County (Morris, J.),
entered March 7, 2012, which dismissed petitioner's application, in a proceeding
pursuant to Family Ct Act article 6, to modify a prior order of custody.

Petitioner (hereinafter the mother) and respondent (hereinafter the father), who never
married or cohabited with one another, are the parents of a son (born in 2007). By order
entered August 11, 2010, Family Court (Argetsinger, J.) awarded the parties joint legal
custody of the child with primary physical placement to the mother and "reasonable and
liberal visitation, including overnights" to the father.

As the father, who underwent brain surgery prior to the child's birth, apparently is
unable to drive and suffers from various disabilities, the mother facilitated visits between
the father and his son and provided the necessary transportation.

In or about February 2011, the mother met her current husband, Kevin Thompson,
who then resided in Oklahoma, online and, in July 2011, Thompson moved to New York
to live with the mother. Shortly thereafter, the mother and Thompson became engaged
and, in February 2012, the two married. The mother testified that during the first six
months of 2011, the father saw the child whenever he wished and that he and the child
regularly enjoyed overnight visitations. The mother also acknowledged that, prior to July
2011, the child asked to speak with the father "all the time" and conceded that
Thompson's arrival was a "turning point" in the [*2]relationship between the child and the father. Indeed, the
record reflects that after July 2011, the mother declined to provide transportation for the
visits, and the father, who apparently otherwise lacked transportation, did not visit with
the child again until December 2011.

In the interim, in May 2011, the mother commenced this proceeding seeking
modification of the prior order of custody to permit her to relocate with the child to
Oklahoma where Thompson's family, including his daughter from a prior relationship,
resided. Following a hearing, at which only the mother and the father appeared and
testified, Family Court (Morris, J.) dismissed the mother's application, finding that she
failed to establish that the proposed relocation was in the child's best interests. This
appeal by the mother ensued.

We affirm. As the party seeking to relocate, the mother bore the burden of
establishing by a preponderance of the credible evidence that the requested relocation
was in the child's best interests (see Matter of Michelle V. v Brandon V., 110 AD3d 1319,
1321 [2013]; Matter of Cole v
Reynolds, 110 AD3d 1273, 1273 [2013]; Matter of Feathers v Feathers, 95 AD3d 1622, 1623
[2012]). Such an inquiry requires a court to consider a variety of factors, including, but
not limited to, "the child's relationship with each parent, the effect of the move on contact
with the noncustodial parent, the potential enhancement to the custodial parent and child
due to the move, and each parent's motives for seeking or opposing the move" (Matter of Batchelder v
BonHotel, 106 AD3d 1395, 1396 [2013] [internal quotation marks and citation
omitted]; see Rose v Buck,
103 AD3d 957, 958 [2013]; Matter of Williams v Williams, 90 AD3d 1343, 1344
[2011]). Inasmuch as "Family Court is in the best position to make factual findings and
credibility determinations, its decision will not be disturbed if it is supported by a sound
and substantial basis in the record" (Matter of Batchelder v BonHotel, 106 AD3d
at 1396; accord Matter of Cole v Reynolds, 110 AD3d at 1274).

Here, it is apparent that the impetus for the proposed move was the mother's recent
marriage, her pregnancy with Thompson's child and her corresponding desire to "start
over" in Thompson's home state of Oklahoma (see Matter of Batchelder v
BonHotel, 106 AD3d at 1396; Scott VV. v Joy VV., 103 AD3d 945, 946 [2013], lv
denied 21 NY3d 909 [2013]). While the mother's new marriage and her desire to
unite her new family are valid considerations (see Matter of Scheffey-Hohle v Durfee, 90 AD3d 1423,
1426 [2011], appeal dismissed 19 NY3d 876 [2012]), the balance of the
Tropea factors (see Matter of Tropea v Tropea, 87 NY2d 727, 740-741
[1996]) do not break in the mother's favor.

As for the potential for economic enhancement, the mother, who was an assistant
manager at a dollar store earning $8.50 per hour, testified that she would be able to
transfer to a similar position at an Oklahoma franchise, where she would earn $9 per
hour. Although the mother also testified that Thompson, who apparently was working at
a local grocery store, would be able to earn several hundred dollars each week as a
flooring contractor in Oklahoma, no specific testimony was received regarding
Thompson's wage-earning capacity in Oklahoma, his current wages in New York or his
efforts to find suitable employment in this state. With respect to educational
opportunities, the mother failed to offer any proof that the Oklahoma school system
represented a significant improvement over the school system available to the child (who
was four years old at the time of the hearing) in Tioga County (see Matter of
Batchelder v BonHotel, 106 AD3d at 1397; Matter of Feathers v Feathers,
95 AD3d at 1624; Matter of Williams v Williams, 90 AD3d at 1344-1345; Matter of Kirshy-Stallworth v
Chapman, 90 AD3d 1189, 1191 [2011]). Additionally, although the mother was
enrolled in nursing school at the time of the hearing and testified that nurses "make really
good money" in Oklahoma, she [*3]acknowledged that it
would take longer to obtain her degree in Oklahoma than it would in New York due to
the need to repeat certain courses. Finally, although the mother offered the father
extended visitation and access to the child via Skype and expressed a willingness to share
transportation costs, there is no question that the proposed relocation would significantly
impair the father's ability to spend time with the child—particularly in view of the
distance involved and the father's disabilities and limited financial resources (see
Matter of Batchelder v BonHotel, 106 AD3d at 1397). In short, inasmuch as the
mother did not meet her burden of establishing that the proposed move would
substantially enhance the child's economic, emotional or educational well-being, Family
Court properly dismissed her application (see id.; Matter of Scheffey-Hohle v
Durfee, 90 AD3d at 1427-1428; Matter of Kirshy-Stallworth v Chapman, 90
AD3d at 1191-1192).

Peters, P.J., Lahtinen and Stein, JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is affirmed,
without costs.
