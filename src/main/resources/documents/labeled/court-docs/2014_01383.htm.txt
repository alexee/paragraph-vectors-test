Respondent,
v
Carlos Ariza, Appellant.


—[*1]


Steven Banks, The Legal Aid Society, New York (Katheryne M. Martone of
counsel), for appellant.

Robert T. Johnson, District Attorney, Bronx (David P. Johnson of counsel), for
respondent.


Judgment, Supreme Court, Bronx County (David Stadtmauer, J.), rendered
September 14, 2010, convicting defendant, after a jury trial, of robbery in the first
degree, and sentencing him to a term of seven years, unanimously affirmed.

Defendant's legal sufficiency claim is unpreserved and we decline to review it in the
interest of justice. As an alternative holding, we reject it on the merits. We also find that
the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence (see People v Danielson, 9
NY3d 342, 348-349 [2007]). There is no basis for disturbing the jury's
determinations concerning credibility and identification, including its evaluation of any
inconsistencies. Defendant was identified by the victim, as well as by a witness who was
acquainted with defendant. Concur—Tom, J.P., Friedman, Saxe, Richter and
Clark, JJ.
