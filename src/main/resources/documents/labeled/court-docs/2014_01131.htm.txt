—[*1]


Steven N. Feinman, White Plains, for appellant.

Michael A. Cardozo, Corporation Counsel, New York (Susan Paulson of counsel),
for respondent.

Tamara A. Steckler, The Legal Aid Society, New York (Diane Pazar of counsel),
attorney for the children.



Order of disposition, Family Court, Bronx County (Kelly A. O'Neill Levy, J.),
entered on or about January 15, 2013, which, to the extent appealed from as limited by
the briefs, brings up for review a fact-finding determination that respondent mother
neglected her son Kesan W. by inflicting excessive corporal punishment, unanimously
affirmed, without costs. Appeal from order of fact-finding, same court and Judge, entered
on or about November 29, 2012, unanimously dismissed, without costs, as superseded by
the appeal taken from the order of disposition. Appeal from order of visitation, same
court and Judge, entered on or about January 15, 2013, unanimously dismissed, without
costs, as abandoned.

The Family Court's neglect finding that respondent inflicted excessive corporal
punishment on her son was supported by a preponderance of the evidence (see Matter of Deivi R. [Marcos
R.], 68 AD3d 498 [1st Dept 2009]). Respondent's son's out-of-court statements,
that respondent had a history of hitting him with a belt, causing bruises to his body, was
properly [*2]admitted into evidence, as they were
corroborated by ACS's caseworker, the Legal Aid Society's social worker, and his
guidance counselor's observations of bruises on his arm (see Matter of Naomi J. [Damon
R.], 84 AD3d 594 [1st Dept 2011]). Concur—Mazzarelli, J.P., Andrias,
DeGrasse and Clark, JJ.
