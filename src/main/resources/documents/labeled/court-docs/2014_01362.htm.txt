Arthur Schwartz, Advocates for Justice Chartered Attorneys, New York City,
appellant pro se, and for Schwartz, Lichten & Bright, PC, appellant.

Marita E. Hyman, West Edmeston, respondent pro se.



Stein, J. Appeal from that part of an order of the Supreme Court (Cerio Jr., J.),
entered December 20, 2012 in Madison County, which partially denied a motion by
defendants Arthur Schwartz and Schwartz, Lichten & Bright, PC to, among other things,
dismiss the complaint.

In August 2007, plaintiff—then a Cornell University graduate
student—was charged with violating the University's Campus Code of Conduct by
allegedly harassing a professor. Following disciplinary proceedings, the University's
Hearing Board sustained the harassment charge and issued a penalty, which was, apart
from a slight modification, affirmed by the University's Review Board. Plaintiff then
retained defendant Arthur Schwartz to represent her in a CPLR article 78 proceeding
challenging the University's determination. In addition, Schwartz represented plaintiff in
a Title IX claim (see 20 USC § 1681 et seq.). After both of those
matters were unsuccessful (Matter of Hyman v Cornell Univ., 82 AD3d 1309 [2011];
Hyman v Cornell Univ., 834 F Supp 2d 77 [2011]), plaintiff commenced the
instant action against Schwartz, defendant Schwartz, Lichten & Bright, PC (hereinafter
the law firm)—Schwartz's former and now dissolved law firm—and
defendants Stuart Lichten and Daniel Bright—his former partners—seeking
damages for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress and legal
malpractice. In the same complaint, plaintiff also challenged an arbitration award made
in Schwartz's favor in connection with a fee dispute between Schwartz and plaintiff.
[*2]
Schwartz and the law firm (hereinafter
collectively referred to as defendants) moved, and Lichten and Bright cross-moved, to
dismiss the complaint for, among other things, failure to state a cause of action and lack
of personal jurisdiction (see CPLR 3211 [a] [7], [8]). Defendants also moved in
the alternative for a change of venue (see CPLR 510 [3]). Supreme Court
partially granted defendants' motion by dismissing the claims against them for intentional
and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and granted the cross motion by Lichten
and Bright in is entirety. Defendants now appeal.

Initially, we reject defendants' argument that Supreme Court should have dismissed
the claims against the law firm due to lack of personal jurisdiction. Supreme Court found
that service was effectuated upon the law firm by delivery of the summons with notice to
Schwartz as an officer/director (see CPLR 311 [a] [1]; Vincent C. Alexander,
Practice Commentaries, McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C311:1 at
359).[FN1]

As limited by their briefs, defendants now argue that, because the law firm was
dissolved, service could only be made through the Secretary of State (see
Business Corporation Law §§ 304, 306 [a]; CPLR 311 [a] [1]; Bruce Supply Corp. v New Wave
Mech., 4 AD3d 444, 445 [2004]; Camacho v New York City Tr. Auth.,
115 AD2d 691, 693 [1985]; see
also Centennial El. Indus., Inc. v Ninety-Five Madison Corp., 90 AD3d 689,
690 [2011], lv dismissed 19 NY3d 936 [2012]; Speroni v Mid-Island
Hosp., 222 AD2d 497, 498 [1995]). However, the record reflects that the law firm's
dissolution postdated the date on which service was purportedly made. Accordingly,
defendants' argument lacks merit and no other challenge to the manner of service upon
the law firm is before us.

We are also unpersuaded by defendants' contention that Supreme Court should have
dismissed plaintiff's first cause of action, which sought a de novo review of an arbitration
award made in connection with the attorney fee dispute between plaintiff and Schwartz.
Under the Rules of the Chief Administrator of the Courts that govern the fee dispute
resolution program (see 22 NYCRR part 137), in the event of a fee dispute
between an attorney and a client, the client may elect to resolve the dispute by arbitration
(see 22 NYCRR 137.2 [a]). Where that process has been utilized, "[a] party
aggrieved by [an] arbitration award may commence an action on the merits of the fee
dispute in a court of competent jurisdiction within 30 days after the arbitration award has
been mailed" (22 NYCRR 137.8 [a]). Here, plaintiff sought arbitration of the fee dispute
between her and Schwartz and, after the award was issued, timely exercised her right to a
de novo review of such award (see Landa v Dratch, 45 AD3d 646, 647-648 [2007]).
Inasmuch as there is nothing in the record indicating that plaintiff previously waived her
right to such review (see 22 NYCRR 137.2 [c]; 137.8 [b]; Eiseman Levine Lehrhaupt &
Kakoyiannis, P.C. v Torino Jewelers, Ltd., 44 AD3d 581, 583 [2007]), Supreme
Court properly denied defendants' motion to dismiss this cause of action.

However, defendants correctly argue that Supreme Court should have granted their
motion to dismiss the legal malpractice claim. It is well established that, "[i]n order to
sustain a claim for legal malpractice, a plaintiff must establish both that the defendant
attorney failed to exercise the ordinary reasonable skill and knowledge commonly
possessed by a member of the legal profession which results in actual damages to a
plaintiff, and that the plaintiff would have succeeded on the merits of the underlying
action but for the attorney's negligence" (Leder v Spiegel, 9 NY3d 836, 837 [2007], cert denied
sub nom. Spiegel v Rowland, 552 US 1257 [2008] [internal quotation marks and
citation omitted]; accord Alaimo
v McGeorge, 69 AD3d 1032, [*3]1034 [2010];
see Kreamer v Town of
Oxford, 96 AD3d 1128, 1128-1129 [2012]; see also MacDonald v Guttman, 72 AD3d 1452,
1454-1455 [2010]; Bixby v
Somerville, 62 AD3d 1137, 1139 [2009]). Here, although the complaint is
replete with allegations of Schwartz's alleged failures to use reasonable and ordinary skill
in connection with both of plaintiff's underlying claims, it contains no allegation that, but
for these alleged failures, plaintiff would have been successful on either claim.[FN2]

Therefore, even if we accept the allegations as true and liberally construe the complaint
to allege negligent representation by Schwartz (see Leon v Martinez, 84 NY2d
83, 87-88 [1994]; Moulton v State of New York, 
114 AD3d 115, 119 [2013]; Scheffield v Vestal Parkway Plaza, LLC, 102 AD3d 992,
993 [2013]), the allegations are insufficient to make out a prima facie case of legal
malpractice (see Kreamer v Town of Oxford, 96 AD3d at 1128; MacDonald
v Guttman, 72 AD3d at 1455).

Finally, we discern no error in Supreme Court's denial of defendants' motion for a
discretionary change of venue (see CPLR 510 [3]). To succeed on such an
application, the moving party must demonstrate that "the convenience of material
witnesses and the ends of justice will be promoted by the change" (CPLR 510 [3]; see Cavazzini v Viennas, 82
AD3d 1343, 1344 [2011]; State of New York v Quintal, Inc., 79 AD3d 1357,
1357-1359 [2010]) and must proffer "detailed relevant information establishing that the
convenience of the nonparty witnesses would be enhanced" (Cavazzini v
Viennas, 82 AD3d at 1344 [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]; accord Manchester Tech. v
Hansen, 6 AD3d 806, 807 [2004]; Singh v Catamount Dev. Corp., 306
AD2d 738, 738 [2003]). Here, Schwartz's unsupported conclusory statement that all of
the witnesses to plaintiff's dealings are located in New York County fell far short of the
required showing, and we decline to disturb Supreme Court's exercise of its discretion in
this regard (see Cavazzini v Viennas, 82 AD3d at 1344). Defendants' remaining
contentions have been considered and are either academic or without merit.

Peters, P.J., Rose and Egan Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is modified, on the
law, without costs, by reversing so much thereof as denied the motion of defendants
Arthur Schwartz and Schwartz, Lichten & Bright, PC to dismiss the fourth cause of
action; motion granted to said extent and said cause of action dismissed; and, as so
modified, affirmed.
