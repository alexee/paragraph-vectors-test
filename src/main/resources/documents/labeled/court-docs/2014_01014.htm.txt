	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Keyon Alleyne, Appellant.


—[*1]


Lynn W.L. Fahey, New York, N.Y. (Kathleen Whooley of counsel), for
appellant.

Kenneth P. Thompson, District Attorney, Brooklyn, N.Y. (Leonard Joblove, Morgan
J. Dennehy, and Claibourne Henry of counsel), for respondent.



Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County
(Chun, J.), rendered August 3, 2011, convicting him of robbery in the first degree and
unlawful possession of marijuana, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence.

Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.

The defendant's contention that the Supreme Court improperly permitted Detective
Timothy Ellis and Janel Parande, who were not witnesses to the crime in question, to
testify that, in their opinions, the person depicted in a surveillance video was the
defendant is unpreserved for appellate review (see CPL 470.05 [2]; People v Ray, 100 AD3d
933, 933 [2012]; People v
Serrano, 74 AD3d 1104, 1106 [2010]; People v Kelly, 67 AD3d 706, 707 [2009]) and, in any
event, is without merit (see
People v Ruiz, 7 AD3d 737, 737 [2004]; People v Magin, 1 AD3d 1024, 1025, People v
Rivera, 259 AD2d 316, 316-317 [1999] [2003]). Although the Supreme Court failed
to give the appropriate limiting instruction concerning the testimony, any error in that
regard was harmless, as there was overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt, and
no significant probability that the error contributed to the defendant's convictions (see
People v Crimmins, 36 NY2d 230, 241-242 [1975]).

The defendant's contention that the Supreme Court erred in permitting testimony by
Ellis that improperly bolstered the complainant's testimony identifying the defendant as
one of his assailants and constituted impermissible hearsay is unpreserved for appellate
review (see CPL 470.05 [2]; People v Austin, 100 AD3d 1010, 1010 [2012]). In any
event, the contention is without merit (see People v Lassiter, 74 AD3d 1094, 1094 [2010];
People v Smalls, 293 AD2d 500, 501 [2002]; People v Williams, 216
AD2d 211, 211 [1995]). Also unpreserved for appellate review are the defendant's
contentions that the Supreme Court erred in permitting testimony by Ellis regarding a
second assailant that improperly bolstered the complainant's testimony identifying the
defendant, and constituted impermissible hearsay, and that the Supreme Court erred in
permitting Parande's testimony identifying the second assailant. In any event, these
contentions are without merit.

As the defendant correctly argues, the prosecutor improperly suggested in his
summation that Parande's identification of the second assailant enhanced the
complainant's [*2]identification of the defendant (see People v Fleming, 76
AD3d 582, 583 [2010]). However, the error was harmless under the circumstances
of this case (see People v Ramirez, 175 AD2d 849, 849 [1991]).

"The right to effective assistance of counsel is guaranteed by the Federal and State
Constitutions" (People v Rivera, 71 NY2d 705, 708 [1988]; see US
Const Sixth Amend; NY Const, art I, § 6; People v Fields, 109 AD3d 553, 554 [2013]). Here, the
defendant was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel under the New York
Constitution because, viewing defense counsel's performance in totality, counsel
provided meaningful representation (see People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 712
[1998]; People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]; People v Fields, 109
AD3d at 554). Further, the defendant was not deprived of the effective assistance of
counsel under the United States Constitution (see Strickland v Washington, 466
US 668 [1984]).

The defendant's contention that the prosecutor made improper comments during
summation is unpreserved for appellate review, as he failed to object to any of the
challenged comments (see CPL 470.05 [2]; People v Amico, 78 AD3d 1190, 1191 [2010]). In any
event, any error was harmless because the evidence of the defendant's guilt was
overwhelming, and there was no significant probability that the error contributed to the
defendant's convictions (see People v Crimmins, 36 NY2d 230, 241-242 [1975];
People v Smith, 36 AD3d
836, 837 [2007]).

The sentence imposed was not excessive (see People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80
[1982]). Mastro, J.P., Austin, Sgroi and Miller, JJ., concur.
