In an action, inter alia, to recover damages for false imprisonment and malicious
prosecution, the defendant City of New York appeals, as limited by its brief, from so
much of an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Velasquez, J.), dated June 29,
2012, as denied those branches of its motion which were for summary judgment
dismissing the causes of action alleging false imprisonment and malicious prosecution
insofar as asserted against it.

Ordered that the order is reversed insofar as appealed from, on the law, with costs,
and those branches of the motion of the defendant City of New York which were for
summary judgment dismissing the causes of action alleging false imprisonment and
malicious prosecution insofar as asserted against it are granted.

"In order to prevail on a cause of action seeking to recover damages for false arrest
or imprisonment, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) the defendant intended to confine the
plaintiff; (2) the plaintiff was aware of the resulting confinement; (3) the plaintiff did not
consent to the confinement; and (4) the confinement was not otherwise privileged" (Rivera v County of Nassau, 83
AD3d 1032, 1033 [2011]; see Broughton v State of New York, 37 NY2d
451, 456 [1975], cert denied sub nom. Schanbarger v Kellogg, 423 US
929 [1975]). "The existence of probable cause serves as a legal justification for the arrest
and an affirmative defense to the claim of false imprisonment or false arrest" (Rivera
v County of Nassau, 83 AD3d at 1033 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see
Broughton v State of New York, 37 NY2d at 458; Smith v County of
Nassau, 34 NY2d 18, 23 [1974]).

Contrary to the Supreme Court's determination, the City of New York demonstrated
its prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law dismissing the plaintiff's false
imprisonment claim. " 'Generally, information provided by an identified citizen accusing
another individual of a specific crime is legally sufficient to provide the police with
probable cause to arrest' " (Rivera v County of Nassau, 83 AD3d at 1033,
quoting People v Bero, 139 AD2d 581, 584 [1988]; see Minott v City of New
York, 203 AD2d 265, 267 [1994]; Shapiro v County of Nassau, 202 AD2d
358 [1994]). Here, the City established the existence of probable cause to arrest the
defendant by presenting evidence that an identified citizen accused the plaintiff of a
specific crime. The plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact in opposition (see Redmond v City of White
Plains, 77 AD3d 902, 902 [2010]). [*2]Accordingly, the Supreme Court should have granted that
branch of the City's motion which was for summary judgment dismissing the false
imprisonment cause of action.

"The elements of the tort of malicious prosecution are: (1) the commencement or
continuation of a criminal proceeding by the defendant against the plaintiff, (2) the
termination of the proceeding in favor of the accused, (3) the absence of probable cause
for the criminal proceeding and (4) actual malice" (Broughton v State of New
York, 37 NY2d at 457; see Colon v City of New York, 60 NY2d 78, 82
[1983]). "Once a suspect has been indicted, . . . the indictment creates a
presumption of probable cause to believe that the suspect committed the crime" (Chetrick v Cohen, 52 AD3d
449, 450 [2008]; see Colon v City of New York, 60 NY2d at 82-83; Strange v County of
Westchester, 29 AD3d 676, 677 [2006]). "The presumption may be overcome
only by evidence establishing that the police witnesses have not made a complete and full
statement of facts either to the Grand Jury or to the District Attorney, that they have
misrepresented or falsified evidence, [or] that they have withheld evidence or otherwise
acted in bad faith" (Colon v City of New York, 60 NY2d at 82-83). Here, the
City demonstrated its prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law by showing
that the plaintiff was indicted by a grand jury for the subject incident, thus creating a
presumption of probable cause.

The plaintiff asserts that a fingerprint analysis report, which was prepared after the
victim and the lead detective testified before the grand jury, exonerated him and rebutted
the presumption of probable cause created by the grand jury indictment. Contrary to the
plaintiff's contention, the fingerprint analysis report did not exonerate him, but instead
constituted "conflicting evidence uncovered in the course of the police investigation" that
was "relevant to the issue of whether guilt beyond a reasonable doubt could have been
proven at a criminal trial, not to the initial determination of the existence of probable
cause" (Agront v City of New York, 294 AD2d 189, 190 [2002]; see Lewis v Caputo, 20 NY3d
906, 907 [2012]; Medina v
City of New York, 102 AD3d 101, 107 [2012]; Carthens v City of New
York, 168 AD2d 408 [1990]; cf. Kemp v Lynch, 275 AD2d 1024,
1025-1026 [2000]). The plaintiff's further contention that the lead detective withheld the
report from the grand jury and the Kings County District Attorney's office (hereinafter
the DA's office) is purely speculative (see Strange v County of Westchester, 29
AD3d at 676), and the record does not support his contention that the criminal
investigation was conducted in a manner which deviated so egregiously from proper
police procedure as to indicate intentional or reckless action by the lead detective (see
Lee v City of Mount Vernon, 49 NY2d 1041, 1042-1043 [1980]; cf. Haynes v City of New
York, 29 AD3d 521, 522-523 [2006]; Hernandez v State of New York,
228 AD2d 902, 905 [1996]). Accordingly, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of
fact in opposition to the City's prima facie showing, and the City was entitled to summary
judgment dismissing the malicious prosecution cause of action.

On appeal, the plaintiff also accuses the DA's office of wrongdoing in connection
with his criminal proceeding. The plaintiff's contentions with respect to the DA's office,
however, are not properly before this Court, as they are based on arguments and evidence
provided for the first time in the plaintiff's surreply papers submitted to the Supreme
Court (see Sawyers v
Troisi, 95 AD3d 1293, 1294 [2012]; Lenox Hill Hosp. v Government Empls. Ins. Co., 89 AD3d
905, 905 [2011]; Fotiadis v
Fotiadis, 18 AD3d 699, 700 [2005]). Moreover, the plaintiff withdrew all claims
against the DA's office, leaving the City as the only remaining defendant in this case. The
DA's office is an entity separate from the City (see Narvaez v City of New York, 83 AD3d 516, 517
[2011]; Leftenant v City of New
York, 70 AD3d 596, 597 [2010]; Warner v City of New York, 57 AD3d 767, 768 [2008]).
While "a 42 USC § 1983 claim may be maintained against the City for the conduct
of the District Attorney's office, insofar as the District Attorney acted as a New York City
policymaker" (Johnson v Kings County Dist. Attorney's Off., 308 AD2d 278,
296 [2003]; see Ramos v City of New York, 285 AD2d 284, 303 [2001]), the
plaintiff withdrew his 42 USC § 1983 claims against the City.

In light of our determination, we need not address the City's remaining contentions.
Rivera, J.P., Leventhal, Hall and Roman, JJ., concur.
