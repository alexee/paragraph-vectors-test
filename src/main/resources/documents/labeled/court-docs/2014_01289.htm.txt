In an action, inter alia, for a judgment declaring that front and rear yard setback lines
drawn on a certain subdivision map are deed restrictions that run with the land and for
injunctive relief, the defendants appeal (1), as limited by their brief, from so much of an
order of the Supreme Court, Westchester County (Lefkowitz, J.), dated April 17, 2012,
as, upon renewal and reargument, adhered to its original determination in an order of the
same court dated March 26, 2012, granting the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment
on the complaint and denying their cross motion, in effect, for summary judgment
declaring that the front and rear yard setback lines drawn on the subdivision map are not
deed restrictions that run with the land, and (2) from a judgment of the same court dated
April 17, 2012, which, upon the order dated March 26, 2012, is in favor of the plaintiffs
and against them declaring, inter alia, that the front and rear yard setback lines drawn on
the subdivision map are deed restrictions that run with the land, and permanently
enjoining the defendants from, among other things, performing any construction in
violation of those setback lines.

Ordered that the appeal from the order dated April 17, 2012, is dismissed; and it is
further,

Ordered that the judgment is reversed, on the law, the order dated April 17, 2012, is
vacated, the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is denied, the defendants' cross
motion for summary judgment is granted, the order dated March 26, 2012, is modified
accordingly, and the matter is remitted to the Supreme Court, Westchester County, for
the entry of an appropriate amended judgment, inter alia, declaring that the front and rear
yard setback lines drawn on the subdivision map are not deed restrictions that run with
the land; and it is further,

Ordered that one bill of costs is awarded to the defendants.

The appeal from the order dated April 17, 2012, must be dismissed because the right
of direct appeal therefrom terminated with the entry of judgment in the action (see
Matter of Aho, 39 NY2d 241 [1976]). The issues raised on the appeal from that
order are brought up for review and have [*2]been
considered on the appeal from the judgment (see CPLR 5501 [a] [1]).

The plaintiffs and the defendants are neighbors in the Forest Harbor subdivision in
Rye. The Forest Harbor subdivision is in an R-3 zoning district which, inter alia, requires
front yard setbacks of at least 30 feet. The plaintiffs own and reside at 10 Philips Lane,
and the defendants reside at 3 Philips Lane. The defendants also own the residential
property located at 12 Philips Lane, which is adjacent to the plaintiffs' property at 10
Philips Lane and is the subject of this dispute. The defendants purchased 12 Philips Lane
with the intention of tearing down the existing house on the property and building a new
house on the property. The defendants' proposed house has a front yard setback of 44.75
feet.

While the defendants were attempting to obtain the various approvals required to
build their new house from the City of Rye Planning Commission (hereinafter the
Planning Commission), the plaintiffs commenced this action against the defendants for
declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs alleged, inter alia, that the front and rear
yard setback lines which were drawn on the Forest Harbor subdivision map, which map
was approved by the Planning Commission in 1967, required, among other things, front
yard setbacks of at least 60 feet. The plaintiffs further alleged that these setbacks were
deed restrictions that ran with the land. The plaintiffs sought, inter alia, a declaration that
the front and rear yard setback lines drawn on the subdivision map are deed restrictions
that run with the land, and an injunction permanently enjoining the defendants from
performing any construction in violation of those setback lines.

The plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on the complaint, and the defendants
cross-moved, in effect, for summary judgment declaring that the front and rear yard
setback lines drawn on the subdivision map are not deed restrictions that run with the
land. The Supreme Court granted the plaintiffs' motion and denied the defendants' cross
motion.

The Supreme Court should have denied the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment
on the complaint. "[T]he policy of the law is to favor free and unobstructed use of realty"
(Huggins v Castle Estates, 36 NY2d 427, 430 [1975]). "[A] purchaser takes with
notice from the record only of incumbrances in his direct chain of title. In the absence of
actual notice before or at the time of his purchase or of other exceptional circumstances,
an owner of land is only bound by restrictions if they appear in some deed of record in
the conveyance to himself or his direct predecessors in title" (Buffalo Academy of
Sacred Heart v Boehm Bros., 267 NY 242, 250 [1935]). "A purchaser is not
normally required to search outside the chain of title" (Matter of Ioannou v Southold
Town Planning Bd., 304 AD2d 578, 578 [2003], citing Buffalo Academy of
Sacred Heart v Boehm Bros., 267 NY 242 [1935]). Deed restrictions are strictly
construed against those seeking to enforce them and will be enforced only where their
existence has been established by clear and convincing proof (see Matter of Ioannou
v Southold Town Planning Bd., 304 AD2d 578 [2003], citing Witter v
Taggart, 78 NY2d 234, 237-238 [1991]).

In this case, the plaintiffs failed to make a prima facie showing that the front and rear
yard setback lines drawn on the subdivision map are deed restrictions that run with the
land. Contrary to the plaintiffs' contention, there is nothing in the defendants' chain of
title which indicates that these setback lines are deed restrictions that run with the land
(see Huggins v Castle Estates, 36 NY2d at 430-431; Matter of Fuentes v Planning Bd.
of the Vil. of Woodbury, 82 AD3d 883, 884-885 [2011]; Matter of Ioannou
v Southold Town Planning Bd., 304 AD2d at 579). Since the plaintiffs failed to
establish their prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, their motion should
have been denied, regardless of the sufficiency of the defendants' opposition papers
(see Winegrad v New York Univ. Med. Ctr., 64 NY2d 851, 853 [1985]).

The defendants established their prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of
law by submitting the documents in their chain of title, which do not provide any
indication that the front and rear yard setback lines drawn on the subdivision map are
deed restrictions that run with the land (see Huggins v Castle Estates, 36 NY2d at
430-431; Matter of Fuentes v Planning Bd. of the Vil. of Woodbury, 82 AD3d at
884-885; Matter of Ioannou v Southold Town Planning Bd., 304 AD2d at 579).
In opposition, the plaintiffs failed to raise a triable issue of fact. Accordingly, the
Supreme Court should have granted the defendants' cross motion, in effect, for summary
judgment [*3]declaring that the front and rear yard set
back lines drawn on the subdivision map are not deed restrictions that run with the land.

In light of our determination, the defendants' remaining contentions have been
rendered academic.

Since this is, in part, a declaratory judgment action, the matter must be remitted to the
Supreme Court, Westchester County, for the entry of an appropriate amended judgment,
inter alia, declaring that the front and rear yard setback lines drawn on the subdivision
map are not deed restrictions that run with the land (see Lanza v Wagner, 11
NY2d 317 [1962], appeal dismissed 371 US 74 [1962], cert denied 371
US 901 [1962]). Mastro, J.P., Cohen, Miller and Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur.
