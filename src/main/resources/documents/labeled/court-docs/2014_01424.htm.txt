v
State of New York,
Respondent.


—[*1]


Hoberman & Trepp, P.C., Bronx, N.Y. (Adam F. Raclaw of counsel), for
appellant.

Eric T. Schneiderman, Attorney General, New York, N.Y. (Michael S. Belohlavek
and David Lawrence III of counsel), for respondent.



In a claim to recover damages for personal injuries, the claimant appeals from a
judgment of the Court of Claims (DeBow, J.), dated May 25, 2012, which, upon a
decision of the same court dated April 10, 2012, granting the defendant's application to
dismiss the claim made at the close of a trial on the issue of liability, dismissed the claim.

Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, with costs.

On February 24, 2009, the claimant was in the waiting area of the office of the New
York State Workers' Compensation Board located at 111 Livingston Street in Brooklyn.
As the claimant was sitting on a wooden bench reading a newspaper, he observed a
security guard talking on a cell phone while looking out a window. During the phone
conversation, the security guard was informed of his grandmother's death and, in reaction
to that news, went over to the waiting area and punched a wooden bench that was in
front of the claimant, causing it to fall on the claimant. Subsequently, the claimant filed
this claim against the State of New York to recover damages for personal injuries. At the
close of the trial on the issue of liability, the Court of Claims granted the defendant's
application to dismiss the claim.

"Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, an employer can be held vicariously
liable for the torts committed by an employee acting within the scope of the employment"
(Fernandez v Rustic Inn,
Inc., 60 AD3d 893, 896 [2009]; see Riviello v Waldron, 47 NY2d 297,
302 [1979]). "Pursuant to this doctrine, the employer may be liable when the employee
acts negligently or intentionally, so long as the tortious conduct is generally foreseeable
and a natural incident of the employment" (Judith M. v Sisters of Charity Hosp.,
93 NY2d 932, 933 [1999]; see Riviello v Waldron, 47 NY2d at 304; Davis v Larhette, 39 AD3d
693, 694 [2007]). "An employer, however, cannot be held vicariously liable for its
employee's alleged tortious conduct if the employee was acting solely for personal
motives unrelated to the furtherance of the employer's business at the time of the
incident" (Gui Ying Shi v
McDonald's Corp., 110 AD3d 678, 679 [2013]; see Horvath v L & B Gardens,
Inc., 89 AD3d 803, 803 [2011]).

Here, the parties do not dispute that the security guard is an employee of the
defendant for purposes of tort liability under the doctrine of respondeat superior.
However, the defendant is not vicariously liable for the security guard's conduct because
the evidence at trial [*2]established that the security
guard was acting solely for personal motives unrelated to the defendant's business at the
time of the incident (see Gui Ying Shi v McDonald's Corp., 110 AD3d at
680; Horvath v L & B Gardens, Inc., 89 AD3d at 803; Bowman v State of New York,
10 AD3d 315, 316-317 [2004]). Furthermore, the evidence failed to demonstrate
that the security guard's conduct was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant (see
Gui Ying Shi v McDonald's Corp., 110 AD3d at 680; Bowman v State of New
York, 10 AD3d at 317). Accordingly, the Court of Claims properly granted the
defendant's application and dismissed the claim. Skelos, J.P., Chambers, Hall and Miller,
JJ., concur.
