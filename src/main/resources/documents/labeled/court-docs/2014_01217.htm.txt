	In the Matter of Alicia Keen, Respondent, v Anthony
Stephens, Appellant. (And Another Related Proceeding.)


—[*1]


Teresa C. Mulliken, Harpersfield, for appellant.

Paul G. Madison, Stamford, for respondent.

Jehed D. Diamond, Delhi, attorney for the child.



Peters, P.J. Appeal from an order of the Family Court of Delaware County (Lambert,
J.), entered April 19, 2012, which, among other things, granted petitioner's application, in
a proceeding pursuant to Family Ct Act article 6, for custody of the parties' child.

Petitioner (hereinafter the mother) and respondent (hereinafter the father) are the
unmarried parents of a son (born in 2010). In May 2011, the mother commenced this
proceeding seeking custody of the child and listed the father as the child's biological
father. After an order of filiation was entered establishing his paternity, the father filed a
petition for custody as well. Family Court granted the mother temporary custody of the
child and, following a fact-finding hearing, awarded sole custody to the mother with
supervised visitation to the father for two hours each week. The order also provided that
the father could apply for a modification after he has undergone a drug and alcohol
evaluation and successfully completed any recommendations stemming therefrom. This
appeal by the father ensued.

An initial custody determination is controlled by the best interests of the child, taking
into consideration such factors as "the parents' past performance and relative fitness, their
willingness to foster a positive relationship between the child and the other parent, as
well as [*2]their ability to maintain a stable home
environment and provide for the child's overall well-being" (Matter of Adams v Morris, 111
AD3d 1069, 1069-1070 [2013]; see Matter of McLaughlin v Phillips, 110 AD3d 1184,
1185 [2013]). Given the superior position of Family Court to evaluate the testimony and
assess the credibility of witnesses, its determination is accorded great deference and will
remain undisturbed so long as it is supported by a sound and substantial basis in the
record (see Matter of Joseph G.
v Winifred G., 104 AD3d 1067, 1068 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 858
[2013]; Matter of Danielle TT.
v Michael UU., 90 AD3d 1103, 1103 [2011]; Matter of Torkildsen v
Torkildsen, 72 AD3d 1405, 1406 [2010]).

By his own admission, the father has a long-standing history of marihuana use. He
openly acknowledged that he smokes marihuana "once or twice a week" and has done so
for "years"—including during periods of time that he was responsible for caring
for his two daughters from a previous relationship—and stated that "there's no
telling" how much marihuana he will smoke on a given occasion. He was diagnosed with
"[c]annabis [d]ependence" following a court-ordered mental health evaluation and, while
conceding that his marihuana use is both illegal and could impair his ability to care for
his children, the father nonetheless failed to perceive that his routine use of the drug or
its presence in the home was in any way problematic. There was evidence that the father
would consume alcohol and then drive with his daughters in his vehicle, and testimony
was presented as to an incident where he forgot to pick the subject child up from day care
because he had been drinking alcohol. The mother testified that she has concerns about
the father consuming alcohol prior to his visits with the child, explaining that, on at least
one occasion, he showed up to her home for a scheduled visitation with blood shot eyes
and smelling of alcohol. Notably, although the father does not have a driver's license, he
continues to drive his vehicle to the mother's home to attend his visitations.

While the mother has her own shortcomings, she is best able to provide stability in
this young child's life. She has been the child's primary caregiver since birth, has
furnished a safe home environment for him and has aptly addressed his medical needs.
She has also demonstrated a willingness to foster a relationship between the child and the
father, as well as the father's two daughters from a different relationship. Viewing the
evidence in its totality and according appropriate deference to Family Court's credibility
assessments, we find that the award of sole custody to the mother is supported by a sound
and substantial basis in the record (see Matter of Joseph G. v Winifred G., 104
AD3d at 1069; Matter of
Raynore v Raynore, 92 AD3d 1167, 1169 [2012]; Matter of Danielle TT. v
Michael UU., 90 AD3d at 1104; Hughes v Gallup-Hughes, 90 AD3d 1087, 1090 [2011]).
Furthermore, given the father's continued drug use, his diagnoses of cannabis
dependence and the recommendation that he undergo a drug and alcohol evaluation,
Family Court's decision to restrict his visitation to two hours of weekly supervised
visitation was a proper exercise of its discretion (see Matter of Joseph G. v Winifred
G., 104 AD3d at 1069; Matter of Burrell v Burrell, 101 AD3d 1193, 1195 [2012];
Matter of Raynore v Raynore, 92 AD3d at 1169; Matter of Beard v Bailor, 84
AD3d 1429, 1431 [2011]).

Finally, we cannot say that Family Court abused its discretion in failing to sua sponte
appoint an attorney for the child. "While appointment of an attorney for the child in a
contested custody matter remains the strongly preferred practice, 'such appointment is
discretionary, not mandatory' " (Matter of Ames v Ames, 97 AD3d 914, 916 [2012], lv
denied 20 NY3d 852 [2012], quoting Lips v Lips, 284 AD2d 716, 716
[2001]; see Family Ct Act § 249 [a]; Matter of Swett v Balcom, 64 AD3d 934, 936 [2009],
lv denied 13 NY3d 710 [2009]). Under the circumstances of this case, including
the very young age of the child and the absence of any demonstrable prejudice arising
from the failure to appoint an attorney to represent him, we discern no abuse of [*3]discretion (see Moor v Moor, 75 AD3d 675, 678-679 [2010]; Matter of Burdick v Babcock,
59 AD3d 826, 827 [2009]; Matter of Swett v Balcom, 64 AD3d at 936; compare Matter of Robinson v
Cleveland, 42 AD3d 708, 710 [2007]).

Lahtinen, Garry and Rose, JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is affirmed, without
costs.
