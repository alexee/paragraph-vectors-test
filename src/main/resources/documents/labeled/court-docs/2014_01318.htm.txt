v
Dimple
Joshi, Appellant.


—[*1]

Vivek Suri, New York, N.Y., for appellant.

Fulton Friedman & Gullace, LLP, Rochester, N.Y. (Jason P. Verhagen of counsel),
for respondent.



In an action to foreclose a mortgage, the defendant appeals from an order of the
Supreme Court, Nassau County (Iannacci, J.), dated July 24, 2012, which denied her
motion pursuant to CPLR 5015 (a) (1) to vacate her default in answering the complaint
or appearing in the action.

Ordered that the order is affirmed, with costs.

A defendant seeking to vacate a default judgment pursuant to CPLR 5015 (a) (1)
must demonstrate a reasonable excuse for the default and a potentially meritorious
defense (see Eugene Di Lorenzo, Inc. v A.C. Dutton Lbr. Co., 67 NY2d 138, 141
[1986]; Capital Source v AKO
Med., P.C., 110 AD3d 1026, 1026 [2013]; Wells Fargo Bank v Malave, 107 AD3d 880, 881 [2013];
CEO Bus. Brokers, Inc. v
Alqabili, 105 AD3d 989, 990 [2013]). Here, even if the defendant established a
reasonable excuse for her default, she failed to demonstrate that she had a potentially
meritorious defense to this foreclosure action. Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly
denied the defendant's motion pursuant to CPLR 5015 (a) (1) to vacate her default.

The defendant's remaining contentions are without merit. Mastro, J.P., Dickerson,
Lott and Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur.
