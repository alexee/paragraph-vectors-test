Rubert & Gross, P.C., New York, N.Y. (Soledad Rubert of counsel), for
appellant.

Rosenbaum & Taylor, P.C., White Plains, N.Y. (Dara L. Rosenbaum of counsel), for
respondent Mulinos of Westchester, Inc.

In an action, inter alia, to recover damages for personal injuries and wrongful death,
the plaintiff appeals from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Rockland County (Berliner,
J.), entered May 23, 2012, which, upon the granting of the separate motions of the
defendants Mulinos of Westchester, Inc., and Self-Service, Inc., doing business as
Trotters Tavern, pursuant to CPLR 4401, made at the close of evidence, for judgment as
a matter of law dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against each of them, is in
favor of those defendants and against her dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted
against those defendants.

Ordered that the judgment is reversed, on the law, with one bill of costs to the
appellant payable by the respondents appearing separately and filing separate briefs, the
separate motions of the defendants Mulinos of Westchester, Inc., and Self-Service, Inc.,
doing business as Trotters Tavern, pursuant to CPLR 4401 for judgment as a matter of
law dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against each of them are denied, and the
complaint is reinstated insofar as asserted against those defendants.

On February 11, 2005, at approximately 1:45 a.m., while traveling over the Tappan
Zee Bridge, the plaintiff's decedent, John Sullivan (hereinafter Sullivan), lost control of
the vehicle he was operating and was killed when it struck a lamp pole and went over a
guide rail and into the Hudson River. Sullivan, who allegedly was intoxicated at the time
of his death, had patronized establishments owned by the defendant Mulinos of
Westchester, Inc. (hereinafter Mulinos), and Self- Service, Inc., doing business as
Trotters Tavern (hereinafter Trotters Tavern), prior to the accident. The plaintiff
commenced this action against, among others, Mulinos and Trotters Tavern, contending,
inter alia, that they violated General Obligations Law § 11-101 by selling alcoholic
beverages to Sullivan while he was visibly intoxicated.

At trial, the plaintiff presented testimony from, among others, the person who met
[*2]Sullivan at Mulinos and later drove him to Trotters
Tavern, and a patron who socialized with Sullivan for "several hours" at Trotters Tavern.
The plaintiff also presented the testimony of the Rockland County Medical Examiner. At
the conclusion of the plaintiff's case, Mulinos and Trotters Tavern separately moved for
judgment as a matter of law dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against each of
them for failure to establish a prima facie case. The Supreme Court granted both motions
and, in the judgment appealed from, dismissed the complaint insofar as asserted against
Mulinos and Trotters Tavern.

"A trial court's grant of a CPLR 4401 motion for judgment as a matter of law is
appropriate where the trial court finds that, upon the evidence presented, there is no
rational process by which the fact trier could base a finding in favor of the nonmoving
party" (Szczerbiak v Pilat, 90 NY2d 553, 556 [1997]). Applying this standard,
the Supreme Court improperly granted the separate motions by Mulinos and Trotters
Tavern (see Sutter v Inserra
Supermarkets, Inc., 104 AD3d 759 [2013]).

General Obligations Law § 11-101, known as the Dram Shop Act, provides
that a party that "unlawfully" sells alcohol to another person is liable for injuries caused
by reason of that person's intoxication (see Adamy v Ziriakus, 92 NY2d 396, 400
[1998]; Romano v Stanley, 90 NY2d 444 [1997]; LaCatena v M.C. & E.D. Beck,
Inc., 35 AD3d 388 [2006]). Under Alcoholic Beverage Control Law § 65
(2), it is unlawful to furnish an alcoholic beverage to "[a]ny visibly intoxicated person"
(see Adamy v Ziriakus, 92 NY2d at 400).

Contrary to the Supreme Court's conclusion, accepting the evidence presented at trial
by the plaintiff as true, and according it every favorable inference, the plaintiff
established, prima facie, that there was a "reasonable or practical connection" between
the alleged unlawful sale of alcohol at Mulinos and the resulting damages (Sullivan v Mulinos of Westchester,
Inc., 73 AD3d 1018, 1020 [2010] [internal quotation marks omitted]; see McArdle v 123 Jackpot,
Inc., 51 AD3d 743, 746 [2008]; McNeill v Rugby Joe's, 298 AD2d 369,
370 [2002]; Catania v 124 In-To-Go, Corp., 287 AD2d 476, 477 [2001];
Adamy v Ziriakus, 231 AD2d 80, 88 [1997], affd 92 NY2d 396 [1998];
Church v Burdick, 227 AD2d 817, 818 [1996]; Johnson v Plotkin, 172
AD2d 88, 92 [1991]). Although the Medical Examiner acknowledged that the alcohol
that Sullivan consumed at Mulinos would have been metabolized by the time of the
accident, "assum[ing] that [he] did not consume anymore alcohol that evening," she also
opined, based on the testimony of the witnesses and Sullivan's blood alcohol content at
the time of the accident, that Sullivan did indeed consume numerous drinks after leaving
Mulinos. Considering the evidence presented, a jury could have reasonably concluded
that Sullivan remained intoxicated throughout the night, that the alcohol consumed at
Mulinos contributed to his intoxication to an appreciable degree, and thus, that there was
a reasonable and practical connection between the alcohol served at Mulinos and the
damages sustained in the accident (see McArdle v 123 Jackpot, Inc., 51 AD3d at
746; McNeill v Rugby Joe's, 298 AD2d at 370; Catania v 124 In-To-Go,
Corp., 287 AD2d at 477).

The evidence presented by the plaintiff, when accepted as true and afforded every
favorable inference, was also sufficient to establish, prima facie, that Sullivan was
furnished alcohol at Trotters Tavern while he was visibly intoxicated (see Adamy v
Ziriakus, 92 NY2d at 400; Sullivan v Mulinos of Westchester, Inc., 73
AD3d at 1020). The Medical Examiner's opinion, coupled with testimony from the
person who met Sullivan at Mulinos and later drove him to Trotters Tavern, was
sufficient to establish that Sullivan consumed alcohol at Trotters Tavern and that he was
visibly intoxicated at the time (see Adamy v Ziriakus, 92 NY2d at 400;
Sullivan v Mulinos of Westchester, Inc., 73 AD3d at 1020). Moreover,
considering the circumstantial evidence presented, it would have been reasonable and
permissible for a jury to infer that Trotters Tavern furnished the alcohol that Sullivan
consumed (see Adamy v Ziriakus, 92 NY2d at 402-403).

As the plaintiff made out a prima facie case against both Mulinos and Trotters
Tavern for violations of General Obligations Law § 11-101, those defendants'
separate motions for judgment as a matter of law should have been denied and the matter
should have been submitted to the jury. Skelos, J.P., Lott, Cohen and Hinds-Radix, JJ.,
concur.
