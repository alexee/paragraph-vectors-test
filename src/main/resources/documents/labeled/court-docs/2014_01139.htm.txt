v
Windemere
Owners, LLC, et al., Respondents.


—[*1]



Marc Bogatin, New York, for appellant.

Cullen & Troia, P.C., New York (Kevin D. Cullen of counsel), for
respondents.



Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Milton A. Tingling, J.), entered July 24,
2013, which denied plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to liability on her rent
overcharge claim and a declaration that she is entitled to a rent-stabilized lease,
unanimously reversed, on the law, without costs, the motion granted, and it is declared
that plaintiff is entitled to a rent-stabilized lease.

Defendants failed to raise an issue of fact in opposition to plaintiff's prima facie
showing that they did not make sufficiently costly improvements to her rent-stabilized
apartment to permit them to remove the apartment from rent regulation (see
Administrative Code of City of NY §§ 26-504.2, 26-511[c] [13]). To
increase the rent over the demonstrated legal regulated rent, defendants would have had
to make $53,541.60 worth of improvements. However, their own contractors' invoices
show only approximately $33,200 worth of renovations. While defendants' employee's
affidavit in opposition stated that more than $55,000 had been spent on the
improvements, the employee was not a person with knowledge of the facts, and her
statement was unsupported by any admissible evidence, such as affidavits by the various
vendors she claimed would testify to additional improvements at trial, and devoid of an
explanation of why they are not now available (see Castro v New York Univ., 5 AD3d 135 [1st Dept
2004]; CPLR 3212 [b]).

Defendants failed to show that they needed further discovery, especially since they
are not [*2]seeking any records from plaintiff, and they
had 17 months to search their own records (see Bailey v New York City Tr.
Auth., 270 AD2d 156 [1st Dept 2000]; CPLR 3212 [f]). Concur—Mazzarelli,
J.P., Andrias, DeGrasse and Clark, JJ. [Prior Case History: 2013 NY Slip Op
