	In the Matter of Annastasia C. Valmas-Mann, Respondent,
v Mark Loewenguth, Appellant.


—[*1]


Carol Malz, Oneonta, for appellant.

Thomas Garner, Middleburgh, for respondent.

Tracy Donovan Laughlin, Cherry Valley, attorney for the child.

Peters, P.J. Appeal from an order of the Family Court of Otsego County (Burns, J.),
entered July 20, 2012, which granted petitioner's application, in a proceeding pursuant to
Family Ct Act article 6, to modify a prior order of custody.

Pursuant to a consent order entered in October 2007, petitioner (hereinafter the
mother) and respondent (hereinafter the father) shared joint legal and residential custody
of their son (born in 2002). In August 2011, the mother commenced this modification
proceeding seeking sole custody of the child. Following fact-finding and Lincoln
hearings, Family Court granted the mother's petition and awarded her sole legal and
physical custody of the child, with regular periods of visitation to the father. This appeal
by the father ensued.

The father, stating that he is no longer dissatisfied with the custodial arrangement set
forth in Family Court's order, does not seek any affirmative relief from this Court on
appeal. To the extent that the attorney for the child seeks review of the court's
determination, no appeal was taken by the attorney for the child and, therefore, any such
arguments are not properly before us (see Matter of Alyson J. [Laurie J.], 88 AD3d 1201, 1204
[2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 803 [2012]; Matter of Melissa WW. v Conley XX., 88 AD3d 1199,
1201 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 803 [2012]; Matter of Sharyn PP. v Richard QQ., 83 AD3d 1140,
1143-1144 [2011]). Accordingly, [*2]the order is
affirmed.

Stein, McCarthy and Garry, JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is affirmed, without
costs.
