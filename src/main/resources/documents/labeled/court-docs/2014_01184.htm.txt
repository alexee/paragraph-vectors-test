	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Daniel R. Emrich, Appellant.


—[*1]


Robert C. Mitchell, Riverhead, N.Y. (Alfred J. Cicale of counsel), for appellant.

Thomas J. Spota, District Attorney, Riverhead, N.Y. (Michael J. Miller of counsel),
for respondent.



Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Suffolk County
(Hudson, J.), rendered February 6, 2012, convicting him of burglary in the first degree,
upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence. Assigned counsel has submitted a brief in
accordance with Anders v California (386 US 738 [1967]), in which he moves
for leave to withdraw as counsel for the appellant.

Ordered that the motion of Robert C. Mitchell for leave to withdraw as counsel for
the appellant is granted, and he is directed to turn over all papers in his possession to new
counsel assigned herein; and it is further,

Ordered that Richard L. Herzfeld, Esq., 104 W. 40th Street, 20th Floor, New York,
N.Y., 10018, is assigned as counsel to perfect the appeal; and it is further,

Ordered that the People are directed to furnish a copy of the certified transcripts of
the proceedings to the new assigned counsel; and it is further,

Ordered that new counsel shall serve and file a brief on behalf of the appellant within
90 days of the date of this decision and order and the respondent shall serve and file its
brief within 30 days after the brief on behalf of the appellant is served and filed. By prior
decision and order on motion of this Court dated September 20, 2012, the appellant was
granted leave to prosecute the appeal as a poor person, with the appeal to be heard on the
original papers, including a certified transcript of the proceedings, and on the briefs of
the parties, who were directed to file nine copies of their respective briefs and to serve
one copy on each other.

The brief submitted by the appellant's counsel pursuant to Anders v
California (386 US 738 [1967]) is deficient because it fails to analyze potential
appellate issues or highlight facts in the record that might arguably support the appeal (see People v Singleton, 101
AD3d 909, 910 [2012]; People v Ovalle, 99 AD3d 1023, 1024 [2012]; Matter of Giovanni S. [Jasmin
A.], 89 AD3d 252, 256 [2011]). Since the brief does not demonstrate that
assigned counsel fulfilled his obligations under Anders v California, we must
assign new counsel to represent the appellant (see People v Singleton, 101 AD3d
at 910; [*2]People v Ovalle, 99 AD3d at 1024;
Matter of Giovanni S. [Jasmin A.], 89 AD3d at 258). Skelos, J.P., Lott, Roman
and Miller, JJ., concur.
