	Hardev Sahni, Respondent,
v
Kitridge Realty Co.,
Inc., et al., Appellants.


—[*1]


Kral Clerkin Redmond Ryan Perry & Van Etten, LLP, Melville, N.Y. (James V.
Derenze of counsel), for appellants.

Shaub, Ahmuty, Citrin & Spratt, LLP, New York, N.Y. (Sari Havia of counsel), for
respondent.



In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, the defendants appeal from an
order of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (Whelan, J.), dated June 27, 2012, which
denied their motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.

Ordered that the order is affirmed, with costs.

The plaintiff allegedly was injured when he tripped and fell due to a height
differential in a sidewalk abutting premises owned by the defendant Kitridge Realty Co.,
Inc., and maintained by the defendant Building Management Company, Inc. (hereinafter
together the defendants). The defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the
complaint, contending that the alleged defect in the sidewalk was trivial and that, in any
event, they lacked actual or constructive notice of the alleged defect. The Supreme Court
denied the motion, and the defendants appeal.

Generally, whether a condition is dangerous or defective depends on the particular
facts of each case, and is properly a question of fact for the jury unless the alleged defect
is trivial as a matter of law (see Trincere v County of Suffolk, 90 NY2d 976, 977
[1997]; Milewski v Washington
Mut., Inc., 88 AD3d 853, 855 [2011]; Delaney v Town Sports Intl., 88 AD3d 635, 636 [2011]).
In determining whether an alleged defect is trivial as a matter of law, the court must
examine all of the facts presented, including the "width, depth, elevation, irregularity and
appearance of the defect along with the 'time, place and circumstance' of the injury"
(Trincere v County of Suffolk, 90 NY2d at 978, quoting Caldwell v Village
of Is. Park, 304 NY 268, 274 [1952]; see Shmidt v JPMorgan Chase & Co., 112 AD3d 811
[2013]; Milewski v Washington Mut., Inc., 88 AD3d at 855-856). Here, the
evidence that the defendants submitted in support of their motion, including the
photographs of the sidewalk where the plaintiff allegedly was injured, was insufficient to
demonstrate as a matter of law, that the alleged defect was trivial and, therefore, not
actionable (see Trincere v County of Suffolk, 90 NY2d 976 [1997]; Shmidt v
JPMorgan Chase & Co., 112 AD3d at 812; Rogers v 575 Broadway Assoc., L.P., 92 AD3d 857, 858
[2012]; cf. Milewski v Washington Mut., Inc., 88 AD3d at 856).

Additionally, the defendants' evidence did not
demonstrate, prima facie, that the defendants lacked constructive notice of the alleged
defect. The evidence did not establish that the alleged defect was not visible and apparent
and did not exist for a sufficient length of time to permit the defendants to discover and
remedy it (see Perez v 655
Montauk, LLC, 81 AD3d 619, 620 [2011]; Bolloli v Waldbaum, Inc., 71 AD3d 618, 619 [2010]).

The defendants' remaining contentions, having been raised for the first time in the
Supreme Court in the defendants' reply papers, are not properly before this Court (see Adler v City of New York,
52 AD3d 549, 550 [2008]).

Inasmuch as the defendants failed to satisfy their prima facie burden on their motion
for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, it was unnecessary, as the Supreme
Court correctly noted, to consider whether the plaintiff's opposition papers raised a
triable issue of fact (see Long
Is. Light. Co. v Town of N. Hempstead, 101 AD3d 956, 956 [2012]; Cruz v Advanced Concrete Leasing
Corp., 101 AD3d 666, 667 [2012]).

Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly denied the defendants' motion for summary
judgment. Dillon, J.P., Balkin, Chambers and Cohen, JJ., concur.
