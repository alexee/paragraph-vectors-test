	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Robert L. Carter, Appellant.


—[*1]


Robert C. Mitchell, Riverhead, N.Y. (Alfred J. Cicale of counsel), for appellant.

Thomas J. Spota, District Attorney, Riverhead, N.Y. (Marion Tang of counsel), for
respondent.


Appeal by the defendant, as limited by his motion, from a sentence of the County
Court, Suffolk County (Cohen, J.), imposed on June 13, 2012, on the ground that the
sentence was excessive.

Ordered that the sentence is affirmed.

The defendant's valid waiver of his right to appeal precludes review of his contention
that the sentence imposed was excessive (see People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d 257, 264-267 [2011]; People v Ramos, 7 NY3d
737, 738 [2006]; People v
Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 255 [2006]; People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 735
[1998]; People v Azeez, 95
AD3d 1349 [2012]; People
v Foy, 89 AD3d 1103 [2011]). Eng, P.J., Skelos, Leventhal and Sgroi, JJ.,
concur.
