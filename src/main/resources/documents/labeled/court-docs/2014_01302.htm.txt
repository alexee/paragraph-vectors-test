v
Admiral Construction, LLC,
Appellant.


—[*1]


Rabinowitz & Galina, Mineola, N.Y. (Michael R. Galina and Gayle Rosen of
counsel), for appellant.

Zachary W. Carter, Corporation Counsel, New York, N.Y. (Edward F.X. Hart,
Gerald E. Singleton, and Jane L. Gordon of counsel), for respondent.



In an action to recover damages for breach of contract, the defendant appeals from an
order of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Kitzes, J.), entered December 3, 2012,
which denied its motion pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (5) to dismiss the complaint as
time-barred.

Ordered that the order is affirmed, with costs.

On July 3, 2012, the plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant alleging
that the defendant performed defective construction work. The Supreme Court properly
denied the defendant's motion pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (5) to dismiss the complaint as
time-barred. "In moving to dismiss a cause of action pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (5) as
barred by the applicable statute of limitations, a defendant bears the initial burden of
demonstrating, prima facie, that the time within which to commence the action has
expired. The burden then shifts to the plaintiff to raise an issue of fact as to whether the
statute of limitations was tolled or was otherwise inapplicable, or whether it actually
commenced the action within the applicable limitations period" (Matteawan On Main, Inc. v City of
Beacon, 109 AD3d 590, 590 [2013] [citations omitted]). "In cases against
architects or contractors, the accrual date for Statute of Limitations purposes is
completion of performance" (City School Dist. of City of Newburgh v Stubbins &
Assoc., 85 NY2d 535, 538 [1995]). "[C]onstruction may be complete even though
incidental matters relating to the project remain open" (State of New York v
Lundin, 60 NY2d 987, 989 [1983]). Here, in opposition to the defendant's prima
facie showing that the construction project was completed on June 29, 2006, more than
six years prior to the commencement of the action (see CPLR 213 [2]), the
plaintiff raised an issue of fact as to whether certain work that remained uncompleted
until after six years prior to the commencement of the action was not merely incidental to
the project. Mastro, J.P., Dickerson, Lott and Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur.
