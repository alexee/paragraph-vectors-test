Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Cayuga County (Thomas G. Leone,
A.J.), entered August 30, 2012 in a personal injury action. The order, inter alia, denied
the motion of defendant Nothnagle Drilling, Inc. for summary judgment dismissing the
complaint and any cross claims against it.

It is hereby ordered that the order so appealed from is unanimously affirmed without
costs.

Memorandum: Plaintiffs commenced this action seeking damages for personal
injuries, loss of consortium and wrongful death resulting from a motor vehicle accident
in which a vehicle owned by defendant Nothnagle Drilling, Inc. (NDI) and operated by
defendant Edward J. Schmieder (Schmieder), an employee of NDI, struck motorcycles
operated by Steven R. Markham (Steven), Sandra H. Markham (Sandra) and plaintiff
David R. Markham (David). Steven and Sandra were killed in the accident, and David
sustained personal injuries. According to plaintiffs, NDI is vicariously liable for
Schmieder's negligence because Schmieder was operating the NDI-owned vehicle with
NDI's permission. NDI subsequently moved for summary judgment dismissing the
complaint and any cross claims against it, and Supreme Court denied the motion. We
affirm.

" '[I]t is well settled that Vehicle and Traffic Law § 388 (1) creates a strong
presumption that the driver of a vehicle is operating it with the owner's permission and
consent, express or implied, and that presumption continues until rebutted by substantial
evidence to the contrary' " (Margolis v Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 77 AD3d 1317, 1320
[2010]; see Leotta v Plessinger, 8 NY2d 449, 461 [1960], rearg denied 9
NY2d 688 [1961], mot to amend remittitur granted 9 NY2d 686 [1961]). As the
undisputed owner of the subject vehicle, NDI is presumed to have granted permission to
Schmieder to have been operating it at the time of the accident (see Murdza v
Zimmerman, 99 NY2d 375, 380 [2003]; Leotta, 8 NY2d at 461). As the
movant, it was NDI's obligation to rebut the presumption of permission with substantial
evidence (see Matter of
Fiduciary Ins. Co. of Am. [Jackson], 99 AD3d 625, 625 [2012];
Margolis, 77 AD3d at 1320; Power v Hodge, 37 AD3d 1078, 1078-1079 [2007];
Guerrieri v Gray, 203 AD2d 324, 325 [1994]), i.e., "evidence which reasonably
sustains the proposition that permission was not given or was subject to a restriction
. . . with which the operator did not comply" (1A NY PJI3d 1:63 at 85
[2014]; see Orlando v Pioneer Barber Towel Supply Co., 239 NY 342, 345
[1925]). "[S]ummary judgment for the owner will not inexorably follow
whenever the owner and driver disavow consent" but, rather, "whether summary
judgment is warranted depends on the strength and plausibility of the disavowals, and
whether they leave room for doubts that are best left for the jury" to resolve (Country-Wide Ins. Co. v National
R.R. Passenger Corp., 6 NY3d 172, 179 [2006]). In other words, "[w]here the
disavowals are arguably suspect, as where there is evidence suggesting implausibility,
collusion or implied permission, the issue of consent should go to a jury" on the theory
that the determination of the weight to be accorded the disavowals lies with the trier of
fact (id. at 178; see St. Andrassy v Mooney, 262 NY 368, 372 [1933]).

Here, we conclude that NDI failed to meet its initial burden on its motion inasmuch
as there is an issue of fact whether the disavowals of permission by Schmieder and NDI's
primary owner are "arguably suspect" (Country-Wide Ins. Co., 6 NY3d at 178;
see Marino v City of New
York, 95 AD3d 840, 841 [2012]; Power, 37 AD3d at 1078-1079;
Stewart v Town of Hempstead, 204 AD2d 431, 431 [1994]). Although both
Schmieder and NDI's primary owner testified at their depositions that Schmieder was
using the subject vehicle for personal travel without the permission of NDI at the time of
the accident, the record is unclear whether permission for such personal use was in fact
required from NDI's primary owner. Indeed, the record establishes that any limitations on
the use of the subject vehicle were never communicated to Schmieder in writing, and
neither Schmieder nor NDI's primary owner testified at their depositions with specificity
whether or how any such limitations were verbally communicated to Schmieder.
Moreover, there is no evidence whether or how any rule concerning the use of vehicles
for personal travel was communicated to the 8 or 10 other NDI employees who were
assigned NDI-owned vehicles prior to the accident. In addition, Schmieder's access to the
subject vehicle was unfettered and, although NDI paid for fuel for the vehicle, it did not
require Schmieder to record the vehicle's mileage. The record also establishes that
Schmieder could not recall NDI's primary owner ever denying permission to any NDI
employee to use an NDI-owned vehicle for personal travel, and it further establishes that
other NDI employees used their NDI-owned vehicles for personal travel, and that
Schmieder had used the subject vehicle for both local and out-of-town personal travel
prior to the accident. Present—Fahey, J.P., Lindley, Sconiers and Whalen, JJ.
