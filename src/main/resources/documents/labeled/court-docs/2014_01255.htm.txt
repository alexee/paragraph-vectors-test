v
Barnes & Noble,
Inc., Respondent.


—[*1]

Rosenberg, Minc, Falkoff & Wolff LLP, New York (Carmen A. Mesorana of
counsel), for appellant.

Leahey & Johnson, P.C., New York (Joanne Filiberti of counsel), for
respondent.



Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Saliann Scarpulla, J.), entered February
13, 2013, which granted defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing the
complaint, unanimously reversed, on the law, without costs, and defendant's motion
denied.

Plaintiff alleges that he slipped and fell backwards on a wet and greasy substance
after stepping onto a descending escalator on defendant's premises. In response to these
allegations, defendant made a prima facie showing of its entitlement to judgment as a
matter of law. Specifically, defendant submitted, among other things, an expert affidavit
purporting to show that the manner in which plaintiff allegedly fell was not physically
possible, because both the tread and riser configuration of the escalator steps prevent a
slippery surface (see Santoni v
Bertelsmann Prop., Inc., 21 AD3d 712 [1st Dept 2005]). The expert further
stated the treads' coefficient of friction, either wet or dry, exceeded the applicable
standard for slip resistance (see
Ridolfi v Williams, 49 AD3d 295 [1st Dept 2008]; compare Friedman v BHL Realty
Corp., 83 AD3d 510 [1st Dept 2011]).

However, in response, plaintiff raised a triable issue of fact to rebut defendant's
prima facie showing. Plaintiff stated in his affidavit and his deposition testimony that he
saw water on the marble floor near the escalator and that the escalator felt slippery and
greasy as he stepped onto it. In addition, a nonparty witness averred that she saw a wet
and slippery condition on the escalator about 45 minutes to an hour before the accident,
and that as a result, she decided to take the stairs rather than use the escalator (see Morabito v 11 Park Place
LLC, 107 AD3d 472 [1st Dept 2013]; Spitzer v 2166 Bronx Park E.
Corps., 284 AD2d 177 [1st Dept 2001]). This [*2]evidence was sufficient to establish defendant's
constructive notice of the specific wet condition that allegedly caused plaintiff's fall
(see Jones v New York City Hous. Auth., 293 AD2d 371 [1st Dept 2002]).
