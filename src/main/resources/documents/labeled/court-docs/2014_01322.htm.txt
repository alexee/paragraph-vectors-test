Respondents.


—[*1]

Solomon Blum Heymann LLP, New York, N.Y. (Andrew W. Heymann and
Mark J. Eberle of counsel), for appellant.

Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, New York, N.Y. (Aidan Synnott,
Leslie Gordon Fagen, and Katharine E.G. Brooker of counsel), for respondents.



In a probate proceeding in which Betty Kheng Ngoh Phillips petitioned pursuant to
SCPA 1809 to determine the validity of claims against the estate of Cheng Ching Wang,
the petitioner appeals, as limited by her brief, from so much of a decree and order (one
paper) of the Surrogate's Court, Westchester County (Scarpino, Jr., S.), dated May 2,
2012, as, upon a decision of the same court dated April 17, 2012, granted that branch of
the motion of Kenneth Wang, Vera Wang Becker, and Oded Aboodi, the executors of the
decedent's estate, which was for summary judgment dismissing that branch of the
petition which was to determine the validity of the first claim, and dismissed that branch
of the petition.

Ordered that the decree and order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with costs.

The decedent died testate on September 14, 2006. The petitioner, a resident of
Singapore, filed claims against the estate, alleging that she and the decedent had been in
a domestic partnership for more than 30 years. In her first claim, which is at issue on this
appeal, the petitioner alleged breach of an express oral agreement whereby the decedent
agreed to establish a fund to provide her with $10 million prior to his death and $150,000
annually for her life, in exchange for her homemaking and full time support during his
extended stays in Asia. The executors of the decedent's estate (hereinafter the executors)
rejected the petitioner's claims. The petitioner then commenced this proceeding pursuant
to SCPA 1809 to determine the validity of her claims.

The executors moved for summary judgment dismissing the petition, relying in part
upon a July 15, 2004, letter signed by the petitioner in which she agreed to "waive any
claim of any kind or nature against [the decedent], [his] family or [his] estate." The
Surrogate's Court granted that branch of the executors' motion which was for summary
judgment dismissing that branch of the petition which was to determine the validity of
the breach of contract claim, determining that the release was unambiguous and the
petitioner failed to raise a triable issue of fact with respect to her contentions that the
release was procured through duress or undue influence and was unconscionable. The
petitioner appeals.
[*2]
Generally, "a valid release constitutes a complete
bar to an action on a claim which is the subject of the release" (Global Mins. & Metals Corp. v
Holme, 35 AD3d 93, 98 [2006]; see Centro Empresarial Cempresa S.A. v AmÉrica MÃ³vil,
S.A.B. de C.V., 17 NY3d 269, 276 [2011]). A release of all claims is valid
notwithstanding a lack of consideration (see General Obligations Law
§§ 15-303, 5-1103; WDF, Inc. v City of New York, 104 AD3d 557 [2013]). It
may, however, be invalidated for the traditional bases for setting aside written
agreements such as duress, fraud, or mutual mistake, with the burden on the party
seeking to invalidate the release (see Centro Empresarial Cempresa S.A. v
AmÉrica MÃ³vil, S.A.B. de C.V., 17 NY3d at 276).

Here, the executors established their prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter
of law by demonstrating that the petitioner fairly, knowingly, and voluntarily released
any claims against the estate. The petitioner's own deposition testimony established that
there were no threats made to compel her to sign the release (see Matter of
Garvin, 210 AD2d 332 [1994]; cf. Call v Ellenville Natl. Bank, 5 AD3d 521 [2004]). The
fact that the petitioner did not consult with an attorney before signing the release does not
preclude enforcement of the release (see Skluth v United Merchants & Mfrs., 163
AD2d 104, 107 [1990]). Moreover, the petitioner wrote letters to the decedent over the
following year referencing the release without disputing its validity, thus ratifying it
(see Dunn v Nissan Motor Co., 262 AD2d 444 [1999]). In opposition, the
petitioner failed to raise a triable issue of fact (see Zuckerman v City of New
York, 49 NY2d 557, 560 [1980]). Accordingly, the Surrogate's Court properly
granted that branch of the executors' motion which was for summary judgment
dismissing that branch of the petition which was to determine the validity of the breach
of contract claim.

In light of our determination, we need not reach the parties' remaining contentions.
Skelos, J.P., Balkin, Leventhal and Sgroi, JJ., concur.
