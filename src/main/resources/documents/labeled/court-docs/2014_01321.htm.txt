—[*1]

Zachary W. Carter, Corporation Counsel, New York, N.Y. (Francis F. Caputo
and Avshalom Yotam of counsel), for appellant.

Steven Banks, New York, N.Y. (Tamara A. Steckler and Mark Dellaquila of
counsel), for respondent Courtney C.

Linda C. Braunsberg, Staten Island, N.Y., for respondent Uhura W.



In two related juvenile delinquency proceedings pursuant to Family Court Act article
3, the Presentment Agency appeals from two orders (one in each proceeding) of the
Family Court, Kings County (McElrath, J.), both dated October 17, 2012, which
dismissed the petitions without prejudice.

Ordered that the orders are affirmed, without costs or disbursements.

The arguments of the respondent Courtney C. that the appeal from the order
dismissing the petition against him must be dismissed because that order was entered on
consent of the Presentment Agency are foreclosed from review pursuant to the law of the
case doctrine (see Clinkscale v
Sampson, 104 AD3d 722 [2013]). A prior decision and order on motion of this
Court denied that branch of Courtney C.'s motion which sought dismissal of that appeal
on an identical ground. His remaining arguments relating to dismissal of that appeal are
without merit (see Family Ct Act § 365.1 [2] [a]).

However, contrary to the Presentment Agency's contention, its voluntary disclosure
form, which gave an erroneous time and an erroneous location of a showup identification
procedure, did not give the respondents adequate notice of the identification evidence
that the Presentment Agency intended to present at the fact-finding hearing (see
Family Ct Act § 330.2 [2]; cf. CPL 710.30 [1] [b]; People v
Lopez, 84 NY2d 425, 428 [1994]; People v Scott, 222 AD2d 1004 [1995];
People v Sang, 212 AD2d 1024 [1995]; People v Canute, 190 AD2d 745
[1993]; People v Ocasio, 183 AD2d 921 [1992]). The Family [*2]Court properly determined that the Presentment Agency's
failure to comply with Family Court Act § 330.2 (2) required preclusion of the
identification evidence, without regard to whether the respondents were prejudiced by
the lack of notice (see Matter of
Kendell F., 30 AD3d 601 [2006]; cf. People v Lopez, 84 NY2d at 428;
People v Scott, 222 AD2d 1004 [1995]).

The Presentment Agency's remaining contentions are without merit. Skelos, J.P.,
Balkin, Leventhal and Sgroi, JJ., concur.
