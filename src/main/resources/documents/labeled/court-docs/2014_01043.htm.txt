—[*1]


Amdursky, Pelky, Fennell & Wallen, P.C., Oswego (John D. Conners of
counsel), for plaintiffs-appellants.

Hiscock & Barclay, LLP, Syracuse (John M. Nichols of counsel), for
defendant-respondent.



Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Oswego County (Norman W. Seiter, Jr.,
J.), entered September 25, 2012. The order, among other things, dismissed the complaint.

It is hereby ordered that the order so appealed from is unanimously affirmed without
costs.

Memorandum: Plaintiffs appeal from an order that, inter alia, granted that part of
defendant's motion seeking to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the action was
barred by collateral estoppel (see CPLR 3211 [a] [5]), and on the further ground
that, pursuant to CPLR 3211 (c), defendant was entitled to summary judgment because
there was no material issue of fact to be tried. We agree with plaintiffs that Supreme
Court erred in determining that the action was barred by collateral estoppel. Collateral
estoppel "applies only 'if the issue in the second action is identical to an issue which was
raised, necessarily decided and material in the first action, and the plaintiff had a full and
fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the earlier action' " (City of New York v Welsbach
Elec. Corp., 9 NY3d 124, 128 [2007], quoting Parker v Blauvelt Volunteer
Fire Co., 93 NY2d 343, 349 [1999]). We conclude that the primary issue in this
action was not previously litigated and decided against plaintiffs in a prior action. We
further conclude, however, that the court, in treating defendant's motion as one for
summary judgment pursuant to CPLR 3211 (c), properly granted the motion. Defendant
met its burden of establishing that it was under no obligation to include plaintiffs in a
"global" settlement agreement that defendant reached with other parties situated similarly
to plaintiffs. In opposition, plaintiffs established only that they had a "mere agreement to
agree" with defendant, which "is unenforceable" (Joseph Martin, Jr., Delicatessen v
Schumacher, 52 NY2d 105, 109 [1981]; see Willmott v Giarraputo, 5 NY2d
250, 253 [1959]). Thus, it was insufficient to defeat defendant's motion (see generally
Zuckerman v City of New York, 49 NY2d 557, 562 [1980]). Present—Centra,
J.P., Fahey, Lindley, Sconiers and Whalen, JJ.
