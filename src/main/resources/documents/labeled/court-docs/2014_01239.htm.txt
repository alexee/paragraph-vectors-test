v
Leon Jones, Appellant.


—[*1]


Robert S. Dean, Center for Appellate Litigation, New York (Jody Ratner of
counsel), for appellant.

Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., District Attorney, New York (Yuval Simchi-Levi of counsel),
for respondent.



Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Edward J. McLaughlin, J.), entered on or
about February 25, 2013, which adjudicated defendant a level three sexually violent
offender pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act (Correction Law art 6-C),
unanimously affirmed, without costs.

Regardless of whether points should have been assessed under factor 1 for
defendant's use of "forcible compulsion" or because he was "armed with a dangerous
instrument," the record supports the court's alternate finding that a discretionary upward
departure to level three was warranted under the circumstances (see People v Ratcliff, 107
AD3d 476 [1st Dept 2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 852 [2013]; see also People v Larkin, 66
AD3d 592, 593 [1st Dept 2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 704 [2010]). Clear and
convincing evidence established aggravating factors that were not otherwise adequately
taken into account by the risk assessment instrument, including the egregiousness of the
sex offenses committed against two children and the threats defendant made to his
victims to keep them from reporting his crimes.

The court also properly exercised its discretion in denying defendant's application for
a downward departure because the mitigating factors asserted by defendant, including his
age and [*2]lack of prior criminal history, were
adequately taken into account by the risk assessment instrument, and were outweighed by
the seriousness of the underlying sex crimes (see e.g. People v Melendez, 83 AD3d 448 [1st Dept
2011]). Concur—Gonzalez, P.J., Tom, Saxe, Freedman and Manzanet-Daniels, JJ.
