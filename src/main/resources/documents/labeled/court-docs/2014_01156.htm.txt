	Stephanie Restuccio, Appellant,
v
David A.
Caffrey, Respondent, et al., Defendant.


—[*1]


Rappaport, Glass, Levine & Zullo, LLP, Hauppauge, N.Y. (Matthew Zullo of
counsel), for appellant.

Epstein Gialleonardo & Frankini, Mineola, N.Y. (Helayne D. Rojas of counsel), for
respondent.



In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, the plaintiff appeals from an
order of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (Baisley, Jr., J.), dated December 19, 2012,
which, upon denying her motion for leave to serve a second supplemental bill of
particulars, in effect, precluded her from serving a second supplemental bill of
particulars.

Ordered that the order is reversed, on the law, with one bill of costs payable by the
defendant David A. Caffrey, the plaintiff's "Verified Second Supplemental Bill of
Particulars" dated August 1, 2012, is deemed a second supplemental bill of particulars,
and the plaintiff's motion is denied as unnecessary.

Where "the plaintiff seeks to allege continuing consequences of the injuries suffered
and described in previous bills of particulars, rather than new and unrelated injuries, the
contested bill of particulars is a supplemental bill of particulars, rather than an amended
bill of particulars" (Erickson v
Cross Ready Mix, Inc., 98 AD3d 717, 718 [2012] [citations omitted]). Here, the
plaintiff's second supplemental bill of particulars alleged that the plaintiff had surgery on
her cervical spine. The plaintiff had already alleged injuries to her cervical spine in her
original bill of particulars and in her supplemental bill of particulars. Thus, the second
supplemental bill of particulars merely sought "to allege continuing consequences of the
injuries suffered and described in previous bills of particular" (id. at 718). Since
the plaintiff served the second supplemental bill of particulars more than 30 days before
trial, leave of court was not required (see CPLR 3043 [b]). Accordingly, the
plaintiff's motion for leave to serve a second supplemental bill of particulars should have
been denied as unnecessary (see
Erickson v Cross Ready Mix, Inc., 98 AD3d 717 [2012]; see also Witherspoon v Surat
Realty Corp., 82 AD3d 1087, 1087-1088 [2011]; Ray v Alpha Omega Dev.
Co., 287 AD2d 446 [2001]). Mastro, J.P., Hall, Austin and Sgroi, JJ., concur.
