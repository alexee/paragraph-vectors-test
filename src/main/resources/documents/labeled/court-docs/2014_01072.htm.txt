	Robert Berkley Physical Therapy, P.C.,
Respondent,
v
The Historic Woodruff Block, LLC, Appellant. (Appeal No.
2.)


—[*1]


Richard Palma, New York City, for defendant-appellant.

Bond, Schoeneck & King, PLLC, Oswego (Scott J. Delconte of counsel), for
plaintiff-respondent.



Appeal from an order and judgment (one paper) of the Supreme Court, Oswego
County (Norman W. Seiter, Jr., J.), entered September 10, 2012. The order and judgment
awarded money damages to plaintiff.

It is hereby ordered that the order and judgment so appealed from is unanimously
affirmed without costs.

Memorandum: Defendant's sole contention on appeal is that a contract was never
formed based on lack or failure of consideration, and thus that Supreme Court erred in
granting plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and entering judgment in plaintiff's
favor. That contention is raised for the first time on appeal and thus is not properly before
us (see Ciesinski v Town of Aurora, 202 AD2d 984, 985 [1994]).
Present—Smith, J.P., Fahey, Carni, Valentino and Whalen, JJ.
