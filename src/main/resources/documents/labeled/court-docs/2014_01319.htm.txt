v
A
Central Insurance Company, Respondent.


—[*1]

Joseph Henig, P.C., Bellmore, N.Y., for appellant.

Gullo & Associates, LLC, Brooklyn, N.Y. (Cristina Carollo of counsel), for
respondent.



In an action to recover no-fault benefits under a policy of automobile insurance, the
plaintiff appeals, as limited by its brief, from so much of an order of the Supreme Court,
Nassau County (Brown, J.), dated July 10, 2012, as denied its motion for summary
judgment on the complaint.

Ordered that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with costs.

Generally, a party opposing a motion for summary judgment need only "raise a
triable issue of fact with respect to the . . . theory . . . that is
the subject of the moving party's prima facie showing" (Stukas v Streiter, 83 AD3d
18, 24 [2011]). Here, in light of the limited basis of the plaintiff's motion for
summary judgment on the complaint, which was premised solely on the defendant's
alleged failure to timely pay or deny the no-fault claim within 30 days of receipt of proof
of the claim (see Insurance Law § 5106 [a]; 11 NYCRR 65-3.8 [a] [1];
[c]), "the defendant's only burden in opposition . . . was to raise a triable
issue of fact regarding its timely . . . denial of the [plaintiff's] claim" (Lenox Hill Hosp. v Government
Empls. Ins. Co., 89 AD3d 905, 905 [2011]; see Viviane Etienne Med. Care,
P.C., v Country-Wide Ins. Co., 114 AD3d 33 [2013]; Westchester Med. Ctr. v
Progressive Cas. Ins. Co., 89 AD3d 1081, 1082-1083 [2011]). In opposition to
the plaintiff's prima facie showing of entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, the
defendant satisfied its burden by raising a triable issue of fact as to whether it did in fact
mail a proper NF-10 denial of claim form to the plaintiff only 22 days after its receipt of
the claim verification that it had previously requested (see Wyckoff Hgts. Med. Ctr. v
Government Empls. Ins. Co., 114 AD3d 
855 [2014]; Westchester Med.
Ctr. v Lancer Ins. Co., 94 AD3d 984 [2012]; Westchester Med. Ctr. v Clarendon
Natl. Ins. Co., 57 AD3d 659 [2008]).

We do not reach the parties' remaining contentions regarding the merits of the
defendant's cross motion, since the defendant has not appealed from so much of the order
as denied its cross motion. Mastro, J.P., Hall, Lott and Sgroi, JJ., concur.
