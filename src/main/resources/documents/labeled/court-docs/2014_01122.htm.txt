Defendants.


—[*1]



Michael Kennedy Karlson, New York, for appellant.

Stein, Wiener & Roth, LLP, Carle Place (Jonathan M. Cohen of counsel), for
respondent.



Order, Supreme Court, Bronx County (Larry S. Schachner, J.), entered November
21, 2012, which granted plaintiff's motion to vacate a prior order granting defendant
Michelle A. Ned's motion to dismiss the complaint and vacating the Judgment of
Foreclosure and Sale on default, and upon reconsideration, denied defendant's motion,
and reinstated the Judgment of Foreclosure and Sale, unanimously affirmed, without
costs.

In this mortgage foreclosure action, the motion court properly denied defendant's
motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. Defendant waived
the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction since she failed to assert it in her answer and
in the two prior motions she made (see CPLR 320; Ohio Sav. Bank v Munsey, 34
AD3d 659 [2d Dept 2006]). Although defendant is correct that the evidence of her
physical description rebuts the presumption of proper service since it does not match the
description provided by the process server, the court was not required to direct a traverse
hearing since [*2]defendant waived this defense prior to
alerting the court to the discrepancies.

We have considered defendant's remaining contentions and find them unavailing.
Concur—Sweeny, J.P., Renwick, Moskowitz, Richter and Gische, JJ.
