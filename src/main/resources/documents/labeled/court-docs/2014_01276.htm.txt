	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Kevin O. Hamilton, Appellant.


—[*1]


Robert S. Dean, Center for Appellate Litigation, New York (Jan Hoth of
counsel), and DLA Piper LLP, New York (Robert J. Czarnecki Jr., of counsel), for
appellant.

Kevin O. Hamilton, appellant pro se.

Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., District Attorney, New York (Grace Vee of counsel), for
respondent.



Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Bruce Allen, J.), rendered August 24,
2010, convicting defendant, after a jury trial, of two counts of robbery in the second
degree, and sentencing him, as a second violent felony offender, to concurrent terms of
eight years, unanimously affirmed.

The verdict was based on legally sufficient evidence and was not against the weight
of the evidence (see People v
Danielson, 9 NY3d 342, 348-349 [2007]). The course of conduct of defendant
and his companion demonstrated that defendant was "aided by another person actually
present" (Penal Law § 160.10 [1]) who acted, at least, as a lookout during the
robbery. The evidence also established the element of physical injury (see Penal
Law §§ 10.00 [9]; 160.10 [2] [a]), in that the victim's injuries were more
than mere "petty slaps, shoves, kicks and the like" (Matter of Philip A., 49 NY2d
198, 200 [1980]), and clearly caused "more than slight or trivial pain" (People v Chiddick, 8 NY3d
445, 447 [2007]; see also People v Guidice, 83 NY2d 630, 636 [1994]).

Defendant's pro se ineffective assistance of counsel claims are unreviewable on
direct appeal because they involve matters outside the record (see People v
Rivera, 71 NY2d 705, 709 [1988]; People v Love, 57 NY2d 998 [1982]).
Accordingly, since defendant has not made a CPL 440.10 motion, the merits of the
ineffectiveness claims may not be addressed on appeal. In the [*2]alternative, to the extent the existing record permits review,
we find that defendant received effective assistance under the state and federal standards
(see People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 713-714 [1998]; Strickland v
Washington, 466 US 668 [1984]). Concur—Sweeny, J.P., Andrias,
Moskowitz, DeGrasse and Gische, JJ.
