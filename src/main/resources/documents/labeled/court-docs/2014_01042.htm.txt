	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Desmond Bones, Appellant.


—[*1]


Timothy P. Donaher, Public Defender, Rochester (James Eckert of counsel), for
defendant-appellant.

Sandra Doorley, District Attorney, Rochester (Geoffrey Kaeuper of counsel), for
respondent.


Appeal from a judgment of the Monroe County Court (Teresa D. Johnson, A.J.),
rendered November 5, 2009. The judgment convicted defendant, upon his plea of guilty,
of resisting arrest.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.

Memorandum: On appeal from a judgment convicting him upon his plea of guilty of
resisting arrest (Penal Law § 205.30), defendant contends that County Court
abused its discretion in denying his request for an adjournment in order to submit a
written motion to withdraw his plea. We note that the request for an adjournment
occurred after defendant waived his right to appeal and, even assuming, arguendo, that
defendant's waiver of the right to appeal was invalid, we conclude that the court did not
abuse its discretion in denying defendant's request (see People v Degree, 270
AD2d 847, 847 [2000]). Present—Centra, J.P., Fahey, Lindley, Sconiers and
Whalen, JJ.
