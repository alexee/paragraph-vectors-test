Respondent,
v
2504 BPE Realty LLC, Appellant.


—[*1]


Molod Spitz & DeSantis, P.C., New York (Marcy Sonneborn of counsel), for
appellant.

Dinkes & Schwitzer, P.C., New York (Andrea M. Arrigo of counsel), for
respondent.



Order, Supreme Court, Bronx County (Norma Ruiz, J.), entered July 26, 2013, which
denied defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, unanimously
affirmed, without costs.

The court properly found that defendant failed to sustain its initial burden of
demonstrating that its negligence was not a proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries.
Defendant's manager testified that neither he nor the building superintendent inspected
the fire escape at any time (see
Hayes v Riverbend Hous. Co., Inc., 40 AD3d 500, 501 [1st Dept 2007], lv
denied 9 NY3d 809 [2007]; Perez v 2305 Univ. Ave., LLC, 78 AD3d 462, 463 [1st
Dept 2010]). Numerous witnesses and a surveillance video indicated that the drop down
ladder on the fire escape may not have functioned properly, since it did not extend to the
ground. Witnesses and the video indicate that persons evacuating the building because of
the fire had to jump off the ladder or be assisted to the ground. Defendant failed to
demonstrate as a matter of law that the resulting delay in getting off the fire escape was
not a significant factor in plaintiff's accident. Concur—Mazzarelli, J.P., Acosta,
Renwick, Freedman and Manzanet-Daniels, JJ.
