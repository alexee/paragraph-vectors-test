v
Lynch Park, LLC, et
al., Respondents.


—[*1]



Boris Kogan, New York, N.Y. (David Binson of counsel), for appellant.

Wenig Saltiel LLP, Brooklyn, N.Y. (Meryl L. Wenig and Scott F. Loffredo of
counsel), for respondents.



In an action, inter alia, to recover damages for breach of contract and to confirm an
arbitration award, the plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings
County (Bunyan, J.), dated December 14, 2011, which denied his motion for summary
judgment on the cause of action to confirm the arbitration award and granted the cross
motion of the defendants Efraim Weiss and Aaron Weiss for summary judgment
dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against them.

Ordered that the order is affirmed, with costs.

The Supreme Court properly denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on
the cause of action to confirm an arbitration award and properly granted the cross motion
of the defendants Efraim Weiss and Aaron Weiss (hereinafter together the Weiss
defendants) for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against
them (see Winegrad v New York Univ. Med. Ctr., 64 NY2d 851, 853 [1985];
Zuckerman v City of New York, 49 NY2d 557, 559 [1980]). The plaintiff failed
to meet his burden of establishing, prima facie, his entitlement to judgment as a matter of
law on his cause of action to confirm the arbitration award and, thus, his motion was
properly denied (see Winegrad v New York Univ. Med. Ctr., 64 NY2d at 853).
Rather, the Weiss defendants established, on their cross motion, their entitlement to
dismissal of that cause of action, as the plaintiff's attempt to confirm the arbitration
award by motion was in contravention of the procedures required by article 75 of the
CPLR and, in any event, the agreement to arbitrate did not sufficiently evidence the
parties' clear, explicit and unequivocal agreement to arbitrate (see God's Battalion of Prayer
Pentecostal Church, Inc. v Miele Assoc., LLP, 6 NY3d 371, 374 [2006];
Matter of Waldron [Goddess], 61 NY2d 181, 183 [1984]; Messiah's Covenant Community
Church v Weinbaum, 74 AD3d 916 [2010]).

Moreover, the Weiss defendants were entitled to summary judgment dismissing the
causes of action alleging breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and specific
performance. The Weiss defendants established, as a matter of law, that they did not
enter into a contract with the plaintiff and did not own, possess, or occupy the property
which the plaintiff contends he is entitled to purchase. In opposition, the plaintiff failed
to raise a triable issue of fact (see Alvarez v Prospect Hosp., 68 NY2d 320, 324
[1986]). The plaintiff's remaining contentions are without merit. Thus, the [*2]Supreme Court properly directed dismissal of the plaintiff's
breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and specific performance causes of action, insofar
as asserted against the Weiss defendants. Dillon, J.P., Balkin, Chambers and Cohen, JJ.,
concur.
