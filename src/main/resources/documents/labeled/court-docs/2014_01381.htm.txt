Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Shirley Werner Kornreich, J.),
entered December 13, 2012, dismissing the complaint, unanimously affirmed, with costs.
Appeal from order, same court and Justice, entered September 25, 2012, unanimously

Plaintiffs' status as former bondholders does not render the "no action" clauses of the
indentures governing the bonds inapplicable to them (Bank of N.Y. v Battery Park
City Auth., 251 AD2d 211 [1st Dept 1998]). Nor are they excused from compliance
by the indentures "principal and interest" clauses, which only authorize actions for past
due principal and interest (id.). Concur—Tom, J.P., Friedman, Saxe and
Clark, JJ. [Prior Case History: 37 Misc 3d 854.]
