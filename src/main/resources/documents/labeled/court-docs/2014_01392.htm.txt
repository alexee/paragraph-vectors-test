Order, Supreme Court, Bronx County (Julia I. Rodriguez, J.), entered on or about
December 6, 2012, which granted the petition for a permanent stay of arbitration of an

Supreme Court, based on the evidence presented at a framed issue hearing,
concluded that there was no contact between the truck driven by respondent and an
unidentified car. Respondent's testimony was not credited by Supreme Court and there is
no basis to upset such finding (see Matter of Travelers Prop. & Cas. Co. of Am. v Mayen, 82
