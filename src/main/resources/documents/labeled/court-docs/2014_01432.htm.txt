Appellant,
v
Hoti Enterprises, L.P., Respondent, et al.,
Defendants.


—[*1]



DLA Piper LLP (US), New York, N.Y. (Joshua A. Sohn, George B. South III,
and Jermaine L. McPherson of counsel), for appellant.

Arnold E. DiJoseph, P.C., New York, N.Y. (Arnold E. DiJoseph III, of counsel), for
respondent.


In an action to foreclose a consolidated mortgage, the plaintiff appeals from an
amended order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Lewis, J.), dated January 10, 2013,
which, among other things, in effect, granted the motion of the defendant Hoti
Enterprises, L.P., for a preliminary injunction.

Ordered that the amended order is reversed, on the law, with costs, and the motion of
the defendant Hoti Enterprises, L.P., for a preliminary injunction is denied as academic.

In light of our determination on a related appeal (see GECMC 2007-C1 Burnett
St., LLC v Hoti Enterprises, L.P., 115 AD3d 
642 [2014] [decided herewith]), awarding the plaintiff summary judgment on the
complaint, the motion of the defendant Hoti Enterprises, L.P., for a preliminary
injunction must be denied as academic (see Village/Town of Mount Kisco v Rene Dubos Ctr. for Human
Envts., Inc., 12 AD3d 501, 502 [2004]). Balkin, J.P., Chambers, Austin and
Roman, JJ., concur.
