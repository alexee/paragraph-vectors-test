	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Perry Board, Appellant.


—[*1]



Robert S. Dean, Center for Appellate Litigation, New York (Jan Hoth of
counsel), and Kaye Scholer LLP, New York (Navin K. Pant of counsel), for appellant.

Robert T. Johnson, District Attorney, Bronx (Ravi Kantha of counsel), for
respondent.


Judgment, Supreme Court, Bronx County (Alvin Yearwood, J.), rendered March 22,
2012, convicting defendant, after a nonjury trial, of two counts of harassment in the
second degree, and sentencing him to concurrent terms of 15 days, unanimously
affirmed.

The verdict was not against the weight of the evidence (see People v Danielson, 9
NY3d 342, 348-349 [2007]). There is no basis for disturbing the court's credibility
determinations.

The court properly exercised its discretion in declining to admit into evidence
photographs of the victim that were offered to show the victim's demeanor shortly before
she testified, since these photographs lacked sufficient relevance to any material issue in
the case. In any event, the court, sitting as trier of fact, was indirectly made aware of the
alleged contrast between the victim's demeanor before and during her testimony.
Concur—Sweeny, J.P., Andrias, Moskowitz, DeGrasse and Gische, JJ.
