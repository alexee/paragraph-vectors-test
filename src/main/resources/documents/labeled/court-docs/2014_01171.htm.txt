APPEARANCES OF COUNSEL

{**116 AD3d at 45} OPINION OF THE COURT



Per Curiam.

On February 8, 2013, in the Supreme Court, Kings County (Chun, J.), the respondent pleaded guilty to 13 felony counts: 10 counts of grand larceny in the second degree, a class C felony, in violation of Penal Law § 155.40 (1); money laundering in the first degree, a class B felony, in violation of Penal Law § 470.20 (1); scheme to defraud in the first degree, a class E felony in violation of Penal Law § 190.65 (1) (b); and conspiracy in the fourth degree, a class E felony, in violation of Penal Law § 105.10 (1).

The respondent admitted, generally, to various actions involving multiple persons and real properties, resulting in the theft of several million dollars, a portion of which was deposited or transferred into his attorney escrow accounts. As part of his plea, the respondent agreed to the entry of a judgment against him, for the benefit of 10 victims, in an aggregate sum of $5,315,300.

On March 20, 2013, the Supreme Court sentenced the respondent to concurrent indeterminate terms of imprisonment of 2 to 6 years for each of the grand larceny convictions, 3 to 9 years for the money laundering conviction, 2 to 6 years for the scheme to defraud conviction, and 1 to 3 years for the conspiracy conviction. The respondent was also directed to pay a crime victims' assessment fee of $25, a DNA fee of $50, and a surcharge of $300. The respondent failed to notify the Court of his convictions.

Pursuant to Judiciary Law § 90 (4) (a), the respondent was automatically disbarred and ceased to be an attorney upon his conviction of a felony.

Accordingly, the motion of the Grievance Committee for the Tenth Judicial District to strike the respondent's name from the roll of attorneys and counselors-at-law is granted, pursuant to Judiciary Law § 90 (4) (b), to reflect the respondent's automatic disbarment as of February 8, 2013.

Eng, P.J., Mastro, Rivera, Skelos and Dillon, JJ., concur.
