Peters, P.J. Appeal from an order of the Family Court of Ulster County (Mizel, J.),
entered January 7, 2013, which granted petitioner's application, in a proceeding pursuant
to Family Ct Act article 10, to adjudicate respondent's children to be neglected.

Respondent is the mother of Victoria Y. (born in 1996) and Daniel X. (born in
2001). Donald X., respondent's estranged husband, is the biological father of Daniel and
the stepfather of Victoria. Following certain events occurring primarily on May 4, 2011,
petitioner commenced this neglect proceeding against respondent. After a fact-finding
hearing, Family Court found that respondent's escalating, irrational, out-of-control
behavior and repeated threats of violence placed the children in imminent danger of harm
and constituted neglect. Respondent appeals.

"To establish neglect, petitioner must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the children's physical, mental or emotional condition was harmed or is in
imminent danger of such harm as the result of the parent's failure to exercise a minimum
degree of care" (Matter of
Joseph RR. [Lynn TT.], 86 AD3d 723, 724 [2011] [internal quotation marks
and citations omitted]; see
Matter of Alexander G. [Tatiana G.], 93 AD3d 904, 905 [2012]). "[A] finding
of neglect does not require actual injury or impairment, 'but only an imminent threat that
such injury or impairment may result,' " which can be established through a single
incident or circumstance (Matter of Joseph RR. [Lynn TT.], 86 AD3d at 724,
quoting Matter of Shalyse
WW., 63 AD3d 1193, 1195-1196 [2009], lv denied 13 NY3d 704
[2009]; see Matter of Xavier II., 58 AD3d 898, 899 [2009]). Furthermore,
whether a parent is exercising a minimum degree of care requires an objective evaluation
of the parent's behavior, in light of whether a reasonable and prudent parent would have
so acted, or failed to act, under the circumstances (see Matter of Alexander G.
[Tatiana G.], 93 AD3d at 905; Matter of Samuel DD. [Margaret DD.], 81 AD3d 1120,
1122 [2011]; Matter of Mitchell
WW. [Andrew WW.], 74 AD3d 1409, 1412 [2010]).

We find adequate record support for Family Court's finding of neglect. Testimony
regarding the events on May 4, 2011 revealed that a neighbor stopped by respondent's
home in the afternoon, during which time respondent, among other things, made
disparaging and vulgar comments about Victoria, accused Victoria of sleeping with
Donald X. and described her plan to go to the store later that day to purchase a gun to
shoot Victoria and Donald X. Although Victoria was not home at the time, Daniel was,
and the neighbor testified that it was her impression that he overheard what respondent
was saying. Shortly thereafter, when Donald X. called to make sure that Daniel was ready
to be picked up, respondent became increasingly aggravated and angry, screaming
obscenities into the telephone and telling Daniel that she would put a bullet in Donald
X.'s head if Daniel let him into the house. She also threatened to put Daniel's "head
through the wall" if he talked back to her.

Respondent's aberrant behavior continued and culminated in an altercation with
Victoria that evening when she broke down Victoria's bedroom door and door
frame—which nearly landed on Victoria—then hit Victoria with a laptop
computer and threatened to kill her, prompting Victoria to call another neighbor for help.
According to that neighbor, when she arrived at the residence, she saw that the door had
been broken down and witnessed respondent call Victoria vulgar names and spew
murderous threats at her. Such behavior continued after respondent called Victoria's
biological father, screaming that if he did not come get Victoria, the child would be
found in a body bag. Frightened as to what had transpired, Victoria was crying
hysterically and unable to speak while she lay curled in the fetal position on her bed.

Testimony further established that this incident was the culmination of escalating
violent and abusive behavior by respondent toward the children following Donald X.'s
departure from the marital residence approximately six months earlier. Victoria testified
that, on various occasions, respondent engaged in middle-of-the night tirades, waking her
up, calling her vile names and accusing her of having a sexual relationship with Donald
X. Furthermore, respondent, who had a history of mental illness and prescription drug
abuse, would take prescribed medication that would negatively effect her mood, causing
her to "stomp" around the house, clench her teeth and yell. Respondent repeatedly
threatened abuse toward the children and Donald X., which frightened and concerned the
children. Taken as a whole, the foregoing evidence provides a sound and substantial
basis to support Family Court's finding of neglect (see Matter of Joseph RR. [Lynn
TT.], 86 AD3d at 724-725; Matter of Paige AA. [Anthony AA.], 85 AD3d 1213, 1216
[2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 708 [2011]; Matter of Justin O., 28 AD3d 877, 878-879 [2006]; Matter of Michael WW., 20
AD3d 609, 611-612 [2005]; Matter of Richard T., 12 AD3d 986, 987-988 [2004]).
