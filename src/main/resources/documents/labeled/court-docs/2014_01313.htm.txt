v

—[*1]


Edward J. Dunphy, Corporation Counsel, Peekskill, N.Y. (Marie R. Hodukavich
of counsel), for appellant.

Baker Leshko Saline & Blosser, LLP, White Plains, N.Y. (Carla Stella of counsel),
for respondent.



In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, the defendant appeals from an
order of the Supreme Court, Westchester County (Giacomo, J.), entered January 7, 2013,
which denied its motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.

Ordered that the order is reversed, on the law, with costs, and the defendant's motion
for summary judgment dismissing the complaint is granted.

On December 8, 2009, the plaintiff allegedly sustained injuries when she slipped and
fell on loose gravel, stones, and other debris while walking on the roadway in front of
240 Fremont Street in Peekskill. Prior to falling, she had stepped off the sidewalk onto
the roadway upon observing that a portion of the sidewalk had been removed and the
area around that portion had been barricaded. In June 2010, the plaintiff commenced this
action against the City of Peekskill alleging, inter alia, that it had created the gravel,
stone, and debris condition during the course of its sidewalk repair in that it failed to
clean and maintain the area around the work site. The defendant moved for summary
judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that it had not received prior written
notice of the alleged dangerous condition pursuant to the Charter of the City of Peekskill
§ C199 and that it had not created the condition. The Supreme Court denied the
motion.

Where, as here, a municipality has enacted a prior written notice statute, "it may not
be subjected to liability for injuries caused by an improperly maintained street or
sidewalk unless it has received prior written notice of the dangerous condition, or an
exception to the prior written notice requirement applies" (Donnellan v City of New
York, 112 AD3d 780, 780-781 [2013]; see Miller v Village of E. Hampton, 98 AD3d 1007, 1008
[2012]; Trinidad v City of
Mount Vernon, 51 AD3d 661, 662 [2008]). There are two recognized
exceptions to the prior written notice requirement. The only exception relevant here is if
the municipality created the defect or hazard through an affirmative act of negligence (see Donnellan v City of New
York, 112 AD3d 780 [2013]; Keating v Town of Oyster Bay, 111 AD3d 604, 605
[2013]; Avellino v City of New
York, 107 AD3d 836, 837 [2013]; Masotto v Village of Lindenhurst, 100 AD3d 718, 719
[2012]).
[*2]
The Supreme Court erred in denying the
defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. The defendant
established its prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law by demonstrating
that it did not receive prior written notice of the loose gravel, stones, and other debris
upon which the plaintiff allegedly slipped and fell, as required by section C199 of the
Charter of the City of Peekskill, and that it did not create the alleged dangerous condition
through an affirmative act of negligence (see Keating v Town of Oyster Bay, 111
AD3d at 605; Masotto v Village of Lindenhurst, 100 AD3d at 719).

In opposition, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the
defendant received prior written notice of the allegedly dangerous condition, or created it
by an affirmative act of negligence (see Masotto v Village of Lindenhurst, 100
AD3d at 719; Cuebas v City of
Yonkers, 97 AD3d 779, 780 [2012]).

The defendant's remaining contention has been rendered academic in light of our
determination. Dillon, J.P., Balkin, Chambers and Cohen, JJ., concur.
