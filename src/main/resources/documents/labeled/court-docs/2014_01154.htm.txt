	People's United Bank, Respondent,
v
Hallock
Landing Associates, LLC, et al., Appellants, et al.,
Defendants.


—[*1]


Joel D. Katims, P.C., Stony Brook, N.Y., for appellants.

Jaspan Schlesinger LLP, Garden City, N.Y. (Frank C. Dell'Amore of counsel), for
respondent.



In an action to foreclose a mortgage, the defendants Hallock Landing Associates,
LLC, Wolfe Miller, and Salvatore Malguarnera appeal, as limited by their brief, from so
much of an order of the Supreme Court, Suffolk Court (Whelan, J.), dated March 7,
2012, as granted that branch of the plaintiff's motion which was for summary judgment
on the complaint insofar as asserted against them and dismissing their affirmative
defenses and counterclaims, and appointed a referee to compute the amount due to the
plaintiff.

Ordered that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with costs.

The plaintiff met its initial burden of establishing its entitlement to judgment as a
matter of law by producing the subject mortgages, the unpaid notes, and an affidavit of
its vice-president, evidencing the appellants' default in their payment obligations (see Bank of Smithtown v 219 Sagg
Main, LLC, 107 AD3d 654, 655 [2013]; Baron Assoc., LLC v Garcia Group Enters., Inc., 96 AD3d
793 [2012]; Argent Mtge.
Co., LLC v Mentesana, 79 AD3d 1079 [2010]; Wells Fargo Bank v Das Karla,
71 AD3d 1006 [2010]). In response, the appellants failed to raise a triable issue of
fact relating to any bona fide defense to foreclosure (see Bank of Smithtown v 219
Sagg Main, LLC, 107 AD3d at 655; Wells Fargo Bank v Das Karla, 71
AD3d at 1006). The assertions in the affidavit of the appellant Salvatore Malguarnera,
submitted in opposition to the motion, did not raise a triable issue of fact as to whether
the doctrines of promissory estoppel or equitable estoppel acted to bar the foreclosure
action (see Bank of Smithtown v 219 Sagg Main, LLC, 107 AD3d at 655;
Baron Assoc., LLC v Garcia Group Enters., Inc., 96 AD3d at 793). Mastro, J.P.,
Chambers, Lott and Miller, JJ., concur.
