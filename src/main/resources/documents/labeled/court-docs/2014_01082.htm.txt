v
Kevin M. Ehmann,
Respondent.


—[*1]


Finucane & Hartzell, LLP, Pittsford (Daniel O'Brien of counsel), for
plaintiff-appellant.

Law Offices of Karen L. Lawrence, Pittsford (Barney Bilello of counsel), for
defendant-respondent.



Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Monroe County (Evelyn Frazee, J.),
entered September 20, 2012. The order, among other things, granted defendant's motion
to dismiss plaintiff's complaint.

It is hereby ordered that the order so appealed from is unanimously affirmed without
costs.

Memorandum: Supreme Court properly granted defendant's motion to dismiss the
complaint based upon plaintiff's failure to file a summons and complaint within the
statute of limitations. Contrary to plaintiff's contention, we conclude that such nonfiling
may not be corrected or disregarded pursuant to CPLR 2001 (see Goldenberg v Westchester
County Health Care Corp., 16 NY3d 323, 328 [2011]). The court also properly
denied plaintiff's motion seeking permission to file the summons and complaint nunc pro
tunc (see generally Mandel v Waltco Truck Equip. Co., 243 AD2d 542, 543-544
[1997], lv denied 91 NY2d 809 [1998]), inasmuch as granting such relief would
effectively extend the statute of limitations, a result proscribed by CPLR 201 (see
Bradley v St. Clare's Hosp., 232 AD2d 814, 815 [1996]; De Maria v Smith,
197 AD2d 114, 116-117 [1994]). Present—Centra, J.P., Peradotto, Lindley,
Sconiers and Whalen, JJ.
