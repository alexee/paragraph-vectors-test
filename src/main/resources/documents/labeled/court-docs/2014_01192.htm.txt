	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Neil Johnson, Appellant.


—[*1]



Lynn W.L. Fahey, New York, N.Y. (Kathleen Whooley of counsel), for
appellant, and appellant pro se.

Richard A. Brown, District Attorney, Kew Gardens, N.Y. (John M. Castellano,
Johnnette Traill, and Suzanne H. Sullivan of counsel), for respondent.



Appeals by the defendant from two judgments of the Supreme Court, Queens County
(Lasak, J.), both rendered February 16, 2011, convicting him of robbery in the first
degree (three counts) under indictment No. 214/2010, and robbery in the first degree
(two counts) under indictment No. 215/2010, upon jury verdicts, and imposing
sentences. The appeals bring up for review the denial (Grosso, J.), after a hearing, of that
branch of the defendant's omnibus motion which was to suppress statements he made to
law enforcement officials.

Ordered that the judgments are affirmed.

Contrary to the defendant's contention in his pro se supplemental brief, the Supreme
Court properly denied that branch of his omnibus motion which was to suppress
statements he made to law enforcement officials. The hearing court's credibility
determinations are entitled to great deference on appeal, and will not be disturbed unless
clearly unsupported by the record (see People v Davis, 103 AD3d 810, 811 [2013]; People v Martinez, 58 AD3d
870, 870-871 [2009]). Here, the record amply supports the court's conclusion that
the defendant's oral and written statements were admissible, since the hearing testimony
established that the defendant was advised of, and voluntarily waived, his Miranda
rights (see Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436 [1966]) and did not invoke his
right to counsel (see People v
Rushion, 26 AD3d 448 [2006]). Moreover, under the circumstances presented,
and since the defendant remained in continuous custody, the police were not required to
re-administer the Miranda warnings before questioning the defendant again a few
hours later (see People v
Dayton, 66 AD3d 797, 798 [2009]; People v Hasty, 25 AD3d 740, 741 [2006]; People v
Pierre, 300 AD2d 324 [2002]). The defendant's additional challenges to the
suppression ruling raised in his pro se supplemental brief were not presented to the
hearing court and, thus, are not properly before us on the appeals (see generally People v
DeCampoamor, 91 AD3d 669, 670-671 [2012]).

The defendant's contention, advanced in his pro se supplemental brief, that, with
respect to both convictions, the evidence was legally insufficient to establish that he
displayed what appeared to be a firearm (see Penal Law § 160.15 [4]) is
unpreserved for appellate review, since he [*2]did not
make this contention in his motion to dismiss (see CPL 470.05 [2]; People v
Gray, 86 NY2d 10, 19 [1995]; People v Middleton, 52 AD3d 533 [2008]). In any event,
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution (see People v
Contes, 60 NY2d 620, 621 [1983]), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish
the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, upon our independent review
pursuant to CPL 470.15 (5), we are satisfied that the verdicts of guilt were not against the
weight of the evidence (see
People v Romero, 7 NY3d 633 [2006]).

The defendant was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Viewing the
representation in its totality, we conclude that trial counsel rendered effective assistance
under the applicable legal standards (see Strickland v Washington, 466 US 668
[1984]; People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 713-714 [1998]). In this regard, the
defendant has not shown "the absence of strategic or other legitimate explanations" for
the conduct challenged on the appeals (People v Rivera, 71 NY2d 705, 709
[1988]; see People v
Barboni, 21 NY3d 393, 405-406 [2013]; People v McNeal, 111 AD3d 652, 652-653 [2013]).
Mastro, J.P., Austin, Sgroi and Miller, JJ., concur.
