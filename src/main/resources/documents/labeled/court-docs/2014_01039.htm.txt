	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Uda Hidalgo, Appellant.


—[*1]


The Legal Aid Bureau of Buffalo, Inc., Buffalo (Barbara J. Davies of counsel),
for defendant-appellant.

Frank A. Sedita, III, District Attorney, Buffalo (Donna A. Milling of counsel), for
respondent.


Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Erie County (Sheila A. DiTullio,
A.J.), rendered February 29, 2012. The judgment convicted defendant, upon his plea of
guilty, of manslaughter in the first degree.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.

Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon his plea of
guilty of manslaughter in the first degree (Penal Law § 125.20 [1]). Contrary to
defendant's contention, the record establishes that he knowingly, voluntarily and
intelligently waived the right to appeal (see generally People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]),
and that valid waiver forecloses any challenge by defendant to the severity of the
sentence (see id. at 255; see generally People v Lococo, 92 NY2d 825,
827 [1998]; People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737 [1998]).
Present—Scudder, P.J., Fahey, Peradotto, Carni and Valentino, JJ.
