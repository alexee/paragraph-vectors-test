	In the Matter of Ernest Andrus,
Petitioner,
v
Thomas P. DiNapoli, as State Comptroller,
Respondent.


—[*1]

Thomas J. Jordan, Albany, for petitioner.

Eric T. Schneiderman, Attorney General, Albany (William E. Storrs of counsel), for
respondent.



Stein, J. Proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 (transferred to this Court by order
of the Supreme Court, entered in Albany County) to review a determination of
respondent which denied petitioner's application for performance of duty disability
retirement benefits.

In July 2009, petitioner, a correction officer, was involved in a work-related incident
while helping a fellow correction officer subdue an unruly inmate, and he allegedly
sustained injuries to his neck, shoulder and lower back. Petitioner sought medical
treatment and did not return to work. He ultimately applied for, among other things,
performance of duty disability retirement benefits. Petitioner's application was
subsequently denied on the basis that his conceded permanent incapacity was not the
natural and proximate result of an injury sustained in service. Following his timely
redetermination request, a hearing ensued and the Hearing Officer ultimately found, as
relevant here, that petitioner did not meet his burden of proving that his disability was the
natural and proximate result of the work-related incident. Respondent adopted that
determination, with supplemental conclusions of law, and denied the application for
performance of duty disability retirement benefits, prompting the commencement of this
CPLR article 78 proceeding.

We annul. Inasmuch as the parties agree that petitioner is permanently disabled from
performing his duties, the issue before us distills to whether petitioner met his burden of
[*2]demonstrating that his disability was caused by his
workplace injuries (see Matter of Calhoun v New York State & Local Employees'
Retirement Sys., 112 AD3d 1172, 1173 [2013]; Matter of Covelli v DiNapoli, 104 AD3d 1002, 1003
[2013]). In this regard, the record is replete with medical reports from various physicians
who examined petitioner and reached differing conclusions as to the cause of his
disability. The authority to resolve such conflicting medical opinions and to determine
applications for retirement benefits rests with respondent and we will uphold the
determination as long as it is supported by substantial evidence (see Matter of Chichester v
DiNapoli, 108 AD3d 924, 925 [2013]; Matter of Covelli v DiNapoli,
104 AD3d at 1003; Matter of
Ashley v DiNapoli, 97 AD3d 1057, 1059 [2012]). Here, however, we conclude
that the evidence on which respondent relied did not meet that standard.

Petitioner's unrefuted testimony establishes that his back was asymptomatic prior to
the 2009 injury,[FN1]

that he sought treatment the day following the incident and that he never returned to
work thereafter. Petitioner presented reports of his treating physicians, who consistently
opined that his disability was caused by the 2009 incident and that his preexisting
degenerative disk disease became symptomatic as a result of the injury suffered therein.
On the other hand, the report of the expert for the New York State and Local Employees'
Retirement System—which respondent accepted—concluded that
petitioner's disability was the result of an underlying cervical spinal condition and that
the 2009 incident "just aggravated some degeneration leading to symptoms." He
specifically opined that the symptoms resulting from the injury were not the basis of his
disability.

It is axiomatic, however, that " 'when a preexisting dormant disease is aggravated by
an accident, thereby causing a disability that did not previously exist, the accident is
responsible for the ensuing disability' " (Matter of Covelli v DiNapoli, 104 AD3d
at 1003, quoting Matter of Britt
v DiNapoli, 91 AD3d 1102, 1103 [2012]; accord Matter of Tobin v
Steisel, 64 NY2d 254, 259 [1985]; Matter of Sanchez v New York State & Local
Police & Fire Retirement Sys., 208 AD2d 1027, 1028 [1994]). Here, the Retirement
System's own expert asserted that petitioner's back condition "was present prior to the
date of injury, but was not symptomatic and now that it is . . . [the back
condition] is such that he is at significant risk for injury that could be permanent to the
spinal cord." Because it is undisputed that petitioner's back condition became
symptomatic when it was aggravated by the 2009 incident[FN2]

and that he was performing his employment responsibilities without limitation prior to
that time, we find that respondent's determination that petitioner's disability was not the
natural and proximate result of his 2009 work-related injury is not supported by
substantial evidence (see Matter of Covelli v DiNapoli, 104 AD3d at 1003;
Matter of Britt v DiNapoli, 91 AD3d at 1103-1104; Matter of Sanchez,
208 AD2d at 1028; [*3]compare Matter of Ashley v
DiNapoli, 97 AD3d at 1059).

Peters, P.J., McCarthy and Garry, JJ., concur. Adjudged that the determination is
annulled, without costs, petition granted, and matter remitted to respondent for further
proceedings not inconsistent with this Court's decision.



Footnotes




Footnote 1: Although petitioner
denied having prior back problems, he did testify that, years before the incident, he
treated with a chiropractor for soreness of his neck and shoulder muscles.




Footnote 2: Notably, there is no
medical proof in the record to support a conclusion that petitioner's previous sore neck
and shoulder muscles stemmed from this underlying back condition. In fact, one of the
reports of the Retirement System's expert noted that petitioner's back
condition—cervical spinal stenosis—"is a narrowing of the canal in and of
itself [and] is not associated with symptoms."
