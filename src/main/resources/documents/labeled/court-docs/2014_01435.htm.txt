—[*1]


Ishelli Oliver, Brooklyn, N.Y., for appellants-respondents.

Audrey A. Thomas, Rosedale, N.Y., for respondent-appellant.



In an action, inter alia, to impose a constructive trust on certain real property, the
defendants appeal, as limited by their brief, from so much of a judgment of the Supreme
Court, Queens County (Kitzes, J.), entered March 28, 2012, as, upon a decision of the
same court made after a nonjury trial, adjudged the plaintiff and her husband the rightful
owners of the subject property, directed the defendant Keisha McDonald to reconvey the
subject property to the plaintiff and her husband, and, in effect, conditioned the plaintiff's
payment of the sum of $51,000 to the defendant Keisha McDonald upon that defendant's
reconveyance of the subject property to the plaintiff and her husband, and the plaintiff
cross-appeals, as limited by her brief, from so much of the same judgment as directed her
to pay the defendant Keisha McDonald the sum of $51,000.

Ordered that the judgment is reversed insofar as appealed from, on the facts, and the
complaint is dismissed; and it is further,

Ordered that the judgment is affirmed insofar as cross-appealed from; and it is
further,

Ordered that one bill of costs is awarded to the defendants.

"The elements of a constructive trust are a confidential or fiduciary relationship, a
promise, a transfer in reliance thereon, and unjust enrichment" (Williams v Eason, 49 AD3d
866, 868 [2008]; see Sharp v Kosmalski, 40 NY2d 119, 121 [1976]; O'Brien v Dalessandro, 43
AD3d 1123, 1124 [2007]). The ultimate purpose of a constructive trust is to prevent
unjust enrichment, and it will be imposed " '[w]hen property has been acquired in such
circumstances that the holder of the legal title may not in good conscience retain the
beneficial interest' " (Sharp v Kosmalski, 40 NY2d at 121, quoting Beatty v
Guggenheim Exploration Co., 225 NY 380, 386 [1919]; see Rowe v Kingston, 94
AD3d 852, 853 [2012]).

In reviewing a determination made after a nonjury trial, the power of this Court is as
broad as that of the trial court, and we may render a judgment we find warranted by the
facts, bearing in mind that in a close case, the trial court had the advantage of seeing and
hearing the witnesses (see Northern Westchester Professional Park Assoc. v Town of
Bedford, 60 NY2d 492, 499 [1983]; Marini v [*2]Lombardo, 79
AD3d 932, 933 [2010]).

Here, the Supreme Court erred in concluding that the plaintiff satisfied her burden of
proof with respect to the elements necessary to impose a constructive trust. The plaintiff
failed to demonstrate that the defendants would be unjustly enriched by retaining legal
title to the subject premises (see
Losner v Cashline, L.P., 41 AD3d 789 [2007]; Potter v Davie, 275
AD2d 961, 964 [2000]; see also McGrath v Hilding, 41 NY2d 625, 629 [1977]).
Thus, the Supreme Court erred in adjudging the plaintiff and her husband the rightful
owners of the subject property and directing the defendant Keisha McDonald to reconvey
and transfer the deed to the subject property to the plaintiff and her husband.

However, the Supreme Court properly awarded the defendant Keisha McDonald
damages in the amount of $51,000 on her counterclaim as, despite the plaintiff's
contention otherwise, those damages were sufficiently established. Dillon, J.P., Balkin,
Chambers and Cohen, JJ., concur.
