Respondent.


—[*1]


Jeffrey Johnson, New York, appellant pro se.

Gartner & Bloom P.C., New York (Elizabeth Knapp-Demler of counsel), for
respondent.


Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Joan A. Madden, J.), entered March 8,
2013, which, insofar as appealed from as limited by the briefs, denied plaintiff's motion
for summary judgment on his second cause of action for a rent overcharge, unanimously
affirmed, without costs.

Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on his rent overcharge claim was properly
denied. Although the parties' lease erroneously stated that the subject apartment was not
rent-regulated, plaintiff failed to establish as a matter of law that the rent charged
exceeded the statutory legal regulated rent. Concur—Sweeny, J.P., Andrias,
Moskowitz, DeGrasse and Gische, JJ.
