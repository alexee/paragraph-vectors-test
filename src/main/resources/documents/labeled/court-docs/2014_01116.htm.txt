	Larry T. Becker et al., Appellants,
v
Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corporation, Respondent, et al., Defendants.


—[*1]



Carl E. Person, New York, for appellants.

Rosicki, Rosicki & Associates, P.C., Plainview (Andrew Morganstern of counsel),
for respondent.



Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Anil C. Singh, J.), entered August 6,
2013, which granted, without prejudice, defendant's motion to dismiss the action on the
ground of forum non conveniens, unanimously affirmed, without costs.

The motion court providently exercised its discretion in dismissing the action since
plaintiffs' claims lack a substantial nexus with New York. Plaintiffs reside in Illinois, the
note and mortgage are secured by real property in Illinois, and plaintiffs seek reformation
of the note to reflect, among other things, the present value of the real property in
Illinois. In addition, while the promissory note contains no choice of law provision, the
underlying mortgage states that the laws of Illinois shall apply (see Islamic Republic
of Iran v Pahlavi, 62 NY2d 474, 479 [1984], cert denied 469 US 1108
[1985]; see also Farahmand v
Dalhousie Univ., 96 AD3d 618, 619 [1st Dept 2012]).

Although defendant has an office in New York and plaintiffs' note was eventually
securitized by a New York trust, these facts are insufficient to create a factual connection
between New York and the dispute, notwithstanding that certain documents and
witnesses knowledgeable about the securitization are located in New York (Ziska v
Bank of Am., N.A., 99 [*2]AD3d 602 [1st Dept
2012]).

We have considered plaintiffs' remaining arguments and find them unavailing.
