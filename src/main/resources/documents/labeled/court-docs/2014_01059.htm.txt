Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Erie County (Diane Y. Devlin, J.),
entered February 26, 2013 in a personal injury action. The order denied the motion of
defendant for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.

It is hereby ordered that the order so appealed from is unanimously affirmed without
costs.

Memorandum: Plaintiffs commenced this action seeking damages for injuries
sustained by their daughter while skiing. According to plaintiffs, their daughter's arm was
fractured by defendant's "carelessness and negligence" in colliding with their daughter
from behind. We conclude that Supreme Court properly denied defendant's motion for
summary judgment dismissing the complaint because there are issues of fact whether the
doctrine of assumption of the risk applies and whether defendant's carelessness in
colliding with plaintiffs' daughter was reckless conduct.

The daughter testified at her deposition that she was a novice skier and that, at the
time of the collision, she was skiing down an easy trail. As she entered the slow skiing
area near the end of the trail, she heard defendant yell "whoa" three times just before he
struck her from behind. The friend with whom plaintiffs' daughter was skiing asserted in
an affidavit submitted by plaintiffs in opposition to the motion that she observed the
daughter slowly enter the slow skiing area and then observed defendant, who was skiing
"very fast," "r[u]n her over from nearly directly behind," "[w]ithout slowing, stopping or
otherwise turning to avoid" her.

It is well established that, "by engaging in a sport or recreational activity, a
participant consents to those commonly appreciated risks which are inherent in and arise
out of the nature of the sport generally and flow from such participation" (Morgan v
State of New York, 90 NY2d 471, 484 [1997]). "While awareness or appreciation of
such risks must be 'assessed against the background of the skill and experience of the
particular plaintiff' . . . , '[t]he risk of injury caused by another skier is an
inherent risk of downhill skiing' " (DeMasi v Rogers, 34 AD3d 720, 721 [2006]).
Nevertheless, "a sporting participant 'will not be deemed to have assumed the risks of
reckless or intentional conduct' " (Thornton v Rickner, 94 AD3d 1504, 1504 [2012], quoting
Morgan, 90 NY2d at 485). " 'Generally, the issue of assumption of [the] risk is a
question of fact for the jury' " (Hyde v North Collins Cent. School Dist., 83 AD3d 1557,
1558 [2011]; see Clauss v
Bush, 79 AD3d 1397, 1398 [2010]).

Here, even assuming, arguendo, that defendant met his initial burden on the motion
by "establishing that he did not engage in any 'reckless, intentional or other
risk-enhancing conduct not inherent in the activity' of downhill skiing that caused or
contributed to the accident" (Zielinski v Farace, 291 AD2d 910, 911 [2002],
lv denied 98 NY2d 612 [2002]), we conclude that there is a [*2]triable issue of fact whether defendant's conduct rose to the
level of recklessness and thus was over and above the risk assumed by plaintiffs'
daughter, a novice skier who was injured while skiing slowly on an easy trail in a slow
skiing area. Indeed, we note that defendant struck plaintiffs' daughter with such force that
the daughter's arm was "shattered" and defendant's kidney was lacerated, and thus there
is "at least a question of fact as to whether the defendant's speed in the vicinity and
overall conduct was reckless" (DeMasi, 34 AD3d 721-722).
