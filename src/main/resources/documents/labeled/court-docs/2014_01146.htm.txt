In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, etc., the plaintiffs appeal from
so much of an order of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (K. Murphy, J.), dated
February 3, 2012, as denied their motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability
on the cause of action alleging a violation of Labor Law § 240 (1) insofar as
asserted against the defendant Uniondale Union Free School District, without prejudice
to renewal upon the completion of discovery.

Ordered that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with one bill of costs
payable to the respondents appearing separately and filing separate briefs.

In order to establish liability under Labor Law § 240 (1), there must be a
violation of the statute, and the violation must be a proximate cause of the plaintiff's
injury (see Cahill v Triborough
Bridge & Tunnel Auth., 4 NY3d 35, 39 [2004]; Hugo v Sarantakos, 108 AD3d
744, 745 [2013]). However, not every fall from a ladder establishes that the ladder
did not provide proper protection (see Blake v Neighborhood Hous. Servs. of N.Y. City, 1 NY3d
280, 288-289 [2003]; Esteves-Rivas v W2001Z/15CPW Realty, LLC, 104 AD3d
802, 803 [2013]).

Here, the plaintiffs' own submissions demonstrated the existence of triable issues of
fact, inter alia, as to how the injured plaintiff's accident occurred, including whether he
fell because he merely lost his balance (see Robinson v Goldman Sachs Headquarters, LLC, 95 AD3d
1096, 1097-1098 [2012]; Ellerbe v Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 91 AD3d 441, 442
[2012]; Chin-Sue v City of New
York, 83 AD3d 643, 644 [2011]). In any event, the defendants and the
third-party defendant demonstrated that the plaintiffs' motion was premature, as further
discovery may lead to relevant evidence (see CPLR [*2]3212 [f]; Juseinoski v New York Hosp. Med. Ctr. of Queens, 29 AD3d
636, 637 [2006]).

Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly denied the plaintiffs' motion for summary
judgment on the issue of liability on the cause of action alleging a violation of Labor
Law § 240 (1) insofar as asserted against the defendant Uniondale Union Free
School District, without prejudice to renewal upon the completion of discovery. Skelos,
J.P., Dickerson, Chambers and Miller, JJ., concur. [Prior Case History: 2012 NY
