Aged, Appellant,
v
John B. Rhea et al.,
Respondents.


—[*1]


Manhattan Legal Services, New York (Rosalind Black of counsel), for
appellant.

Kelly D. MacNeal, New York (Seth E. Kramer of counsel), for
respondents.


Appeal from judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Arlene P. Bluth, J.),
entered January 31, 2013, granting the cross motion of respondent New York City
Housing Authority (NYCHA) to dismiss the petition, which sought to annul NYCHA's
determination to terminate the tenancy of Sol Rodriguez, and dismissing the proceeding
brought pursuant to CPLR article 78, unanimously held in abeyance, without costs, and
the matter remanded to Supreme Court for a hearing on whether the statute of limitations
should be tolled due to petitioner's mental condition.

In view of NYCHA's apparent departure from its termination of tenancy procedures,
the hearing officer's recommendation of probation and evidence of petitioner's uncertain
mental capabilities, we exercise our discretion to direct further inquiry into her mental
state during the period following the issuance of respondents' determination.
Concur—Tom, J.P., Saxe, DeGrasse, Richter and Clark, JJ.
