Respondent,
v
Luis Robles, Appellant.


—[*1]


Steven Banks, The Legal Aid Society, New York (Jeffrey Dellheim of counsel),
for appellant.

Robert T. Johnson, District Attorney, Bronx (Karen Swiger of counsel), for
respondent.



Judgments, Supreme Court, Bronx County (Albert Lorenzo, J.), rendered December
2, 2004, convicting defendant, upon his pleas of guilty, of two counts of attempted
criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, and sentencing him, as a
second felony offender, to concurrent terms of 1½ to 3 years, and order, same court
and Justice, entered on or about March 7, 2007, which denied defendant's CPL 440.20
motion to set aside the sentences, unanimously affirmed.

Initially, we reject the People's argument that this appeal has been rendered moot by
the fact that defendant has completed his entire sentence. Defendant is not challenging
the length of his sentence. Instead, he is challenging the use of his federal conviction as a
predicate felony. Such a determination has potential consequences (see CPL
400.21 [8] [subsequent use of finding]).

The court properly sentenced defendant as a second felony offender because his prior
federal conviction under the Hobbs Act (18 USC § 1951), which criminalizes the
interference with commerce by robbery or extortion, was the equivalent of a New York
felony (see People v Muniz, 74 NY2d 464 [1989]). Defendant argues that the
Hobbs Act is broader than the New York extortion statute (Penal Law § 155.30
[6]) because the federal statute encompasses the taking of property by threatening to
damage property in the future. However, under the New York statute, larceny by
extortion may be committed by threatening to damage property at any time, whether
immediately or in the future (Penal Law § 155.05 [2] [e] [ii]), and we find nothing
in [*2]the statutory scheme to compel a conclusion that
only an immediate threat would suffice. We have considered and rejected defendant's
remaining arguments. Concur—Tom, J.P., Friedman, Acosta, Andrias and Richter,
JJ.
