—[*1]


Kirschenbaum & Kirschenbaum, P.C., Garden City, N.Y. (Gene W. Rosen of
counsel), for appellant.



In a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 75 to confirm an arbitration award dated
January 16, 2009, the petitioner appeals, by permission, from an order of the Appellate
Term of the Supreme Court for the Second, Eleventh, and Thirteenth Judicial Districts
dated April 11, 2011, which affirmed a judgment of the Civil Court of the City of New
York, Queens County (Culley, J.), dated June 29, 2009, which, upon an order of the same
court entered May 7, 2009, sua sponte directing the dismissal of the petition, dismissed
the proceeding for lack of personal jurisdiction.

Ordered that the order dated April 11, 2011, is reversed, on the law, with costs, the
judgment of the Civil Court of the City of New York, Queens County, dated June 29,
2009, is reversed, the order entered May 7, 2009, is vacated, the petition is reinstated,
and the matter is remitted to the Civil Court of the City of New York, Queens County,
for a determination of the petition on the merits.

The parties entered into a written agreement pursuant to which the petitioner agreed
to provide security monitoring and alarm services to the respondent for a period of 10
years. The agreement provided that, at the option of either party, any dispute between the
parties was to be determined by arbitration administered pursuant to the commercial
arbitration rules of the National Arbitration Association. Those rules, in relevant part,
authorized service of process in any proceeding to confirm an arbitration award to be
effected by regular mail addressed to the respondent or the respondent's attorney.

After securing an arbitration award against the respondent, the petitioner commenced
the instant proceeding to confirm the award, and served the notice of petition and petition
upon respondent and its principal by regular mail. The Civil Court sua sponte dismissed
the proceeding for lack of personal jurisdiction, and the Appellate Term for the Second,
Eleventh, and Thirteenth Judicial Districts affirmed.

CPLR 403 (c) provides that "[a] notice of petition shall be served in the same manner
as a summons in an action." Absent an agreement to the contrary, the simple mailing of a
notice of petition and petition by ordinary mail is not a method of service authorized by
the CPLR for the [*2]commencement of a proceeding
pursuant to CPLR article 75 (see Matter of Star Boxing, Inc. v DaimlerChrysler Motors
Corp., 17 AD3d 372 [2005]). However, parties to an arbitration agreement may
prescribe a method of service different from that set forth in the CPLR (see Matter of
Andy Floors, Inc. [Tyler Constr. Corp.], 202 AD2d 938 [1994]). Here, under the
terms of their agreement, the parties consented to service by mail of a notice of petition
and petition to confirm an arbitration award, pursuant to the commercial arbitration rules
of the National Arbitration Association, which authorized service by regular mail.
Service by regular mail was therefore proper (see Matter of Fernandez [Universal
Underwriters Ins. Co.], 130 AD2d 657 [1987] see also Smith v Positive
Prods., 419 F Supp 2d 437, 446 [SD NY 2005]).

Furthermore, due process does not require actual receipt of the notice of petition or
that the notice procedure eliminate all risk of nonreceipt (see Matter of Case v
Monroe Community Coll., 89 NY2d 438, 442 [1997]). Service of the notice of
petition and petition by regular mail to the address indicated on the parties' contract was
notice reasonably calculated, under all of the relevant circumstances, to apprise the
respondent of the pendency of the proceeding (see Matter of Beckman v Greentree
Sec., 87 NY2d 566, 571 [1996]).

Accordingly, the Civil Court should not have sua sponte dismissed the proceeding
for lack of personal jurisdiction, and the matter must be remitted to that court for a
determination of the petition on the merits. Mastro, J.P., Austin, Sgroi and Miller, JJ.,
concur.
