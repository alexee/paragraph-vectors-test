v
David P. Weiss, as Chairman of the Town of Hempstead Board of
Zoning and Appeals, et al., Respondents.


—[*1]



Forchelli, Curto, Deegan, Schwartz, Mineo & Terrana, LLP, Uniondale, N.Y.
(Eli Elbaum of counsel), for appellant.

Berkman, Henoch, Peterson, Peddy & Fenchel, P.C., Garden City, N.Y. (Peter
Sullivan and Michael J. Bonneville of counsel), for respondents.



In a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 to review a determination of the Board
of Appeals of the Town of Hempstead dated August 24, 2011, after a rehearing, vacating
its prior determination dated June 2, 2010, and thereupon denying the petitioner's
application for a special exception permit, the petitioner appeals from a judgment of the
Supreme Court, Nassau County (Brandveen, J.), entered May 16, 2012, which denied the
petition and dismissed the proceeding.

Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, with costs.

The Code of the Town of Hempstead § 96-1 (A) defines a cabaret, in relevant
part, as "[a]ny room, place or space wherein musical entertainment, singing, dancing in a
designated area or other form of amusement or entertainment is permitted in conjunction
with the sale or service of food or drink to the public." Effective March 31, 1997, the
Town of Hempstead Building Zone Ordinance § 272 (C) (6) was amended to
provide that "the grant of any cabaret use by the Board of Zoning [sic] Appeals shall be
limited to the specific cabaret use applied for and approved by the Board of Zoning [sic]
Appeals and no other cabaret use. This section shall apply to any cabaret use hereafter or
previously granted by the Board of Zoning [sic] Appeals." In its determination dated
August 24, 2011, the Town of Hempstead Board of Appeals (hereinafter BOA)
determined that the above-quoted 1997 amendment to the Building Zone Ordinance was
applicable to the proposed cabaret use of the petitioner's premises, for which a special
exception permit had been granted in 1969 allowing the property to be used as a cabaret.

In a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 to review a determination of a zoning
board of appeals, a zoning board's interpretation of its zoning ordinance is entitled to
great deference and will not be overturned by the courts unless unreasonable or irrational
(see Matter of Kabro Assoc.,
LLC v Town of Islip Zoning Bd. of Appeals, 95 AD3d 1118, 1119 [2012]; Matter of Ferraris v Zoning Bd. of
Appeals of Vil. of Southampton, 7 AD3d 710, 711 [2004]; Matter of Home
Depot USA v Baum, 243 AD2d 476, 478 [1997]). Judicial review is generally
limited to ascertaining whether the action was illegal, arbitrary and capricious, or an
abuse of discretion (see Matter of Ifrah v Utschig, 98 [*2]NY2d 304, 308 [2002]; Matter of Fuhst v Foley, 45
NY2d 441, 444 [1978]; Matter of Kabro Assoc., LLC v Town of Islip Zoning Bd. of
Appeals, 95 AD3d at 1119; Matter of Mejias v Town of Shelter Is. Zoning Bd. of
Appeals, 298 AD2d 458, 458-459 [2002]). As the BOA's interpretation of the zoning
code provision at issue is neither unreasonable nor irrational, we decline to disturb it (see Matter of Kennedy v Zoning
Bd. of Appeals of Vil. of Patchogue, 57 AD3d 546 [2008]).

Moreover, the BOA did not improvidently exercise its discretion when it reopened
and reheard the petitioner's application for a special exception permit after it had
originally granted it (see Matter
of Moore v Town of Islip Zoning Bd. of Appeals, 28 AD3d 772 [2006]). The
petitioner contends that the rehearing was improper because he had relied to his
detriment on the previously granted special exception permit, having expended funds
renovating and altering the premises for its proposed use. However, Town Law §
267-a (12) permits a zoning board to rehear its determination, "provided the board finds
that the rights vested in persons acting in good faith in reliance upon the reheard order,
decision or determination will not be prejudiced thereby." Here, the BOA expressly
found that the petitioner did not rely upon the previously granted special exception
permit in good faith, but rather, the petitioner intentionally misled the BOA concerning
the intended use of the premises at the initial hearing on the application.

A denial of a special exception permit must be supported by evidence in the record
and may not be based solely upon community objection (see Matter of Retail Prop.
Trust v Board of Zoning Appeals of Town of Hempstead, 98 NY2d 190, 196
[2002]). However, where evidence supporting the denial exists, deference must be given
to the discretion of the zoning board, and a court may not substitute its own judgment for
that of the zoning board, even if a contrary determination is supported by the record
(see id; Matter of White
Castle Sys., Inc. v Board of Zoning Appeals of Town of Hempstead, 93 AD3d
731, 732 [2012]).

The BOA's findings pertaining to the petitioner's lack of candor and good faith were
credibility determinations, and issues of credibility were within the sole province of the
BOA to resolve (see Matter of
Jones v Zoning Bd. of Appeals of the Town of Oneonta, 90 AD3d 1280, 1282
[2011]). Moreover, in addition to the objections of members of the community, there was
also evidence presented, which was within the province of the BOA to credit, that
granting the petitioner's application for a special exception permit would have an adverse
impact on neighboring properties (see Matter of Retail Prop. Trust v Board of Zoning
Appeals of Town of Hempstead, 98 NY2d at 196; Brick Hill Constr. Corp. v
Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Town of Somers, 74 AD2d 810, 811 [1980], affd
53 NY2d 621 [1981]).

The petitioner's remaining contention does not require reversal.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly upheld the BOA's denial of the petitioner's
application for a special exception permit. Mastro, J.P., Rivera, Sgroi and Cohen, JJ.,
concur.
