Respondent,
v
Sean L. Sanders, Appellant.


—[*1]


Timothy P. Donaher, Public Defender, Rochester (Kimberly F. Duguay of
counsel), for defendant-appellant.

Sandra Doorley, District Attorney, Rochester (Geoffrey Kaeuper of counsel), for
respondent.



Appeal from a judgment of the Monroe County Court (John J. Connell, J.), rendered
July 23, 2009. The judgment convicted defendant, upon a nonjury verdict, of criminally
negligent homicide and assault in the third degree.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.

Memorandum: On appeal from a judgment convicting him following a nonjury trial
of, inter alia, criminally negligent homicide (Penal Law § 125.10) for punching the
victim in the back of the head and thereby causing his death, defendant contends that the
verdict with respect to that crime is against the weight of the evidence (see generally
People v Bleakley, 69 NY2d 490, 495 [1987]). We reject that contention. "A person
is guilty of criminally negligent homicide when, with criminal negligence, he causes the
death of another person" (Penal Law § 125.10). "A person acts with criminal
negligence with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an
offense when he fails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will
occur or that such circumstance exists[;] [t]he risk must be of such nature and degree that
the failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a
reasonable person would observe in the situation" (§ 15.05 [4]). " '[T]he
carelessness required for criminal negligence . . . must be such that its
seriousness would be apparent to anyone who shares the community's general sense of
right and wrong' " (People v
Conway, 6 NY3d 869, 872 [2006]).

Here, the evidence at trial established that defendant rushed at the victim from
behind and, without warning, delivered a powerful blow with his closed fist to the
victim's head, which resulted in massive bleeding around the victim's brain and,
ultimately, his death. Eyewitnesses described defendant as using all of his body weight
and all of his momentum to deliver a blow that immediately dropped the victim to the
ground. The sound of the punch was described by eyewitnesses as a very loud crack, like
a wooden bat hitting a ball. The medical examiner who performed the autopsy described
the victim's injuries as similar to those she had seen in individuals who were killed in
high-speed automobile collisions. Although defendant is correct that death resulting from
a single punch may be unusual, we have consistently held that one can commit criminally
negligent homicide with a single punch (see People v Bridenbaker, 266 AD2d
875, 875 [1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 917 [2000]; People v Doty, 175
AD2d 564, 564 [1991], lv denied 78 NY2d 1127 [1991]). Viewing the evidence
in light of the elements of the crime of criminally negligent homicide in this nonjury trial
(see People v Danielson, 9
NY3d 342, 349 [2007]), we conclude that, although an acquittal would not have
been unreasonable, it cannot be said that County Court failed to give the evidence the
weight it should be accorded (see generally Bleakley, 69 NY2d at 495; People v Howard, 101 AD3d
1749 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 944 [2013]). Present—Scudder, P.J.,
