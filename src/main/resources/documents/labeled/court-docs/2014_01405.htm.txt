v
Geral Ray, Appellant.


—[*1]


Cardozo Criminal Appeals Clinic, New York (Stanley Neustadter of counsel),
for appellant.

Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., District Attorney, New York (Yuval Simchi-Levi of counsel),
for respondent.


Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Carol Berkman, J.), rendered October
5, 2011, as amended October 15, 2011, convicting defendant, after a jury trial, of
criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree and bail jumping in the
second degree, and sentencing him, as a second felony offender, to consecutive terms of
two to four years, unanimously affirmed.

We reject defendant's claim that the verdict convicting him of criminal possession of
stolen property was against the weight of the evidence (see People v Danielson, 9
NY3d 342, 348-349 [2007]). There is no basis for disturbing the jury's credibility
determinations. There was ample evidence that defendant knowingly participated in a
scheme to use stolen funds from a fraudulent account to purchase and cash money orders,
and that he knowingly possessed stolen property valued in excess of $1,000.

Defendant did not preserve his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence
supporting his bail jumping conviction, and we decline to review it in the interest of
justice. As an alternative holding, we find that the evidence established the elements of
the crime (see Penal Law § 215.56). Concur—Mazzarelli, J.P.,
Acosta, Renwick, Freedman and Manzanet-Daniels, JJ.
