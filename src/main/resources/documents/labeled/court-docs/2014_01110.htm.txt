v
City of New York,
Respondent.


—[*1]


Morelli Alters Rater, P.C., New York (Adam E. Deutsch of counsel), for
appellant.

Michael A. Cardozo, Corporation Counsel, New York (Dona B. Morris of counsel),
for respondent.



Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Carol E. Huff, J.), entered January 8,
2013, dismissing the complaint, unanimously affirmed, without costs.

The court properly directed a verdict for defendant City, as there was no rational
process that would lead the trier of fact to find for plaintiff, who was injured after
stepping into a pothole (see generally Szczerbiak v Pilat, 90 NY2d 553, 556
[1997]). The Pothole Law's written notice requirement (Administrative Code of City of
NY § 7-201 [c] [2]) contains a "written acknowledgement" provision which
permits a lawsuit "where there is documentary evidence showing, as clearly as written
notice to DOT would show, that the City knew of the hazard and had an opportunity to
remedy it" (Bruni v City of New
York, 2 NY3d 319, 326 [2004]). However, repair orders or reports, reflecting
only that pothole repairs had been made to the subject area more than a year before the
accident, are insufficient to constitute prior written notice of the defect that allegedly
caused a plaintiff's injuries (see
Khemraj v City of New York, 37 AD3d 419, 420 [2d Dept 2007]; see also Walker v City of New
York, 34 AD3d 226 [1st Dept 2006]). Here, the record demonstrates that
plaintiff presented no evidence or testimony which contradicted the City's documentation
showing that the subject defect had been repaired, closed, and made safe, more than a
year prior to the accident (see Khemraj at 420).
[*2]
We have considered plaintiff's remaining
contentions, including that the City's failure to honor so-ordered subpoenas warranted the
striking of its answer, and find them unavailing. Concur—Sweeny, J.P., Renwick,
Moskowitz, Richter and Gische, JJ.
