	In the Matter of the Arbitration between Brunswick Central
School District, Respondent, and Brittonkill Teachers Association,
Appellant.


—[*1]

Richard E. Casagrande, New York State United Teachers, Latham (Deborah A.
Milham of counsel), for appellant.

Roemer Wallens Gold & Mineaux, LLP, Albany (Matthew J. Kelly of counsel), for
respondent.



Rose, J. Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court (Zwack, J.), entered December
24, 2012 in Rensselaer County, which granted petitioner's application pursuant to CPLR
7503 to stay arbitration between the parties.

Petitioner and respondent are parties to a collective bargaining agreement
(hereinafter CBA) containing a broad arbitration clause and a grievance procedure
providing that any unresolved grievance is subject to arbitration. After a probationary
social studies teacher received a series of negative evaluations, petitioner's administrators
recommended that the teacher be denied tenure. Respondent then filed a grievance on the
teacher's behalf challenging, among other things, whether petitioner had complied with
the evaluation procedures provided for in the CBA. When petitioner denied the grievance
and terminated the teacher's employment, respondent filed a demand for arbitration and
petitioner then commenced this proceeding seeking a stay pursuant to CPLR 7503 (b).
Supreme Court granted petitioner's request, concluding that the subject matter of the
grievance was not arbitrable because it actually challenged the tenure
decision—over which the parties agree that petitioner has sole
discretion—and not the alleged [*2]failure to
comply with the agreed-upon evaluation procedures.

The petition should have been denied. The court's role in determining applications to
stay arbitration is limited and, as relevant here, requires a determination of whether the
parties have agreed to arbitrate the dispute at issue (see Matter of City of Johnstown
[Johnstown Police Benevolent Assn.], 99 NY2d 273, 278 [2002]; Matter of
Board of Educ. of Watertown City School Dist. [Watertown Educ. Assn.], 93 NY2d
132, 140 [1999]). Inasmuch as respondent has asserted a violation of the evaluation
procedures agreed to by the parties as part of the CBA, there is a rational relationship
between the subject of the grievance and the CBA (see Matter of Board of Educ. of
Middle Is. Cent. School Dist. No. 12 [Middle Is. Teachers Assn.], 50 NY2d 426, 429
[1980]; Matter of Vestal Cent.
School Dist. [Vestal Teachers Assn.], 2 AD3d 1190, 1193 [2003], lv
denied 2 NY3d 708 [2004]; Board of Educ. of Chautauqua Cent. School Dist. v
Chautauqua Cent. School Teachers Assn., 41 AD2d 47, 51 [1973]; see also
Matter of Cohoes City School Dist. v Cohoes Teachers Assn., 40 NY2d 774, 778
[1976]). The question of whether petitioner violated these procedures "goes to the merits
of the grievance, not to its arbitrability" (Matter of Union-Endicott Cent. School Dist. [Union-Endicott
Maintenance Workers' Assn.], 85 AD3d 1432, 1434 [2011]; see Matter of Peters v
Union-Endicott Cent. School Dist., 77 AD3d 1236, 1240 [2010]). "[T]he fact
that the substantive clauses of the contract might not support the grievances
. . . is irrelevant on the threshold question of arbitrability. It is for the
arbitrator, and not the courts, to resolve any uncertainty concerning the substantive rights
and obligations of the[ ] parties' " (Matter of Union-Endicott Cent. School Dist.
[Union-Endicott Maintenance Workers' Assn.], 85 AD3d at 1435, quoting Matter
of Board of Educ. of Deer Park Union Free School Dist. v Deer Park Teachers
Assn., 50 NY2d 1011, 1012 [1980]; see Matter of Enlarged City School Dist. of
Troy [Troy Teachers Assn.], 69 NY2d 905, 906 [1987]).

Lahtinen, J.P., McCarthy and Garry, JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is reversed,
on the law, with costs, and application denied.
