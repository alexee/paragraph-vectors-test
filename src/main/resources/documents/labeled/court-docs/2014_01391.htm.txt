v
Javier Mendez,
Appellant.


—[*1]


Cheven, Keely & Hatzis, New York (William B. Stock of counsel), for
appellant.

Myers, Singer and Galiardo, LLP, New York (Paul A. Cagno of counsel), for
respondent.



Order, Supreme Court, Bronx County (Maryann Brigantti-Hughes, J.), entered
February 27, 2013, which denied defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to
CPLR 3211 (a) (8) based on improper service, and granted plaintiff's cross motion for an
extension of time to re-serve defendant pursuant to CPLR 306-b, unanimously affirmed,
without costs.

The court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint, and granted
plaintiff an extension of time to serve the summons and complaint for good cause shown
and in the interests of justice (see CPLR 306-b). Plaintiff demonstrated good
cause since service was made within two weeks of the filing of the action, at the address
and apartment for defendant listed on the police accident report and shown in a database
search run by plaintiff's process server (see Matter of Board of Mgrs. of Copley Ct. Condominium v Town
of Ossining, 19 NY3d 869, 871 [2012]; Leader v Maroney, Ponzini &
Spencer, 97 NY2d 95, 104-107 [2001]).

In any event, plaintiff demonstrated that the interests of justice warranted the relief
(see Nicodene v Byblos Rest.,
Inc., 98 AD3d 445, 446 [1st Dept 2012]). Defendant's carrier was notified of the
action within days of its filing, and correspondence provided by plaintiff demonstrated
that an exchange of documents and settlement negotiations were ongoing prior to the
filing of the complaint. No prejudice to defendant was shown since plaintiff's cross
motion [*2]for the extension of time to serve defendant
was made approximately four months after the 120-day period had expired. Moreover,
the police accident report supported plaintiff's assertion that the action is potentially
meritorious. Concur—Tom, J.P., Friedman, Saxe, Richter and Clark, JJ.
