Respondent,
v
Chantal Johnson, Appellant.


—[*1]


Robert S. Dean, Center for Appellate Litigation, New York (Katharine Skolnick
of counsel), for appellant.

Robert T. Johnson, District Attorney, Bronx (David P. Johnson of counsel), for
respondent.



Judgment, Supreme Court, Bronx County (Patricia Anne Williams, J.), rendered May
16, 2012, convicting defendant, after a jury trial, of driving while intoxicated (two
counts) and operating a motor vehicle without a license, and sentencing her to a term of
30 days of intermittent imprisonment to be served on weekends, a conditional discharge
for a period of one year and a $300 fine, unanimously modified, as a matter of discretion
in the interest of justice, to the extent of vacating the term of intermittent imprisonment,
and otherwise affirmed.

The fact that a breathalyzer test was administered to defendant more than two hours
after her arrest did not entitle her to a hearing on the reliability of the results (see People v Rosa, 112 AD3d
551 [1st Dept 2013]).

To the extent the court engaged in undue denigration of, or interference with,
defense counsel, reversal is not required because the court's actions did not reach the
level of preventing the jury "from arriving at an impartial judgment on the merits"
(People v Moulton, 43 NY2d 944 [1978]).

The evidence of defendant's furtive behavior at the time of the stop, furnished the
corroboration requirement of CPL 60.50 was satisfied.

We find the sentence excessive to the extent indicated. Concur—Mazzarelli,
J.P., Andrias, DeGrasse and Clark, JJ.
