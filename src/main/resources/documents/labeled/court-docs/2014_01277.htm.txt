	In the Matter of Aldyfrell Gonzalez,
Petitioner,
v
Raymond W. Kelly, as Police Commissioner of the City of New
York, et al., Respondents.


—[*1]


Strazzullo Law Firm PC, Brooklyn (Maria Patelis of counsel), for petitioner.

Michael A. Cardozo, Corporation Counsel, New York (Marta Ross of counsel), for
respondents.



Determination of respondent Police Commissioner, dated March 26, 2012, which
terminated petitioner's employment as a New York City police officer, unanimously
confirmed, the petition denied, and the proceeding brought pursuant to CPLR article 78
(transferred to this Court by order of Supreme Court, New York County [Alice
Schlesinger, J.], entered September 14, 2012), dismissed, without costs.

Substantial evidence supports the findings that petitioner placed false 911 calls
reporting disturbances at a local establishment in retaliation for not being allowed entry
while he was off-duty; that he lied when questioned about the incidents; that he contacted
other officers involved with the investigation after being ordered not to do so; and that he
was discourteous and exhibited unbecoming conduct when he left an obscene and
verbally abusive message for his former girlfriend, threatening her with being arrested
and issued summonses (see Matter of Purdy v Kreisberg, 47 NY2d 354, 358
[1979]). There exists no basis to disturb the credibility determinations of the Hearing
Officer (see Matter of Berenhaus v Ward, 70 NY2d 436, 443-444 [1987]).

Given the seriousness of the sustained charges, the penalty of termination does not
shock our sense of fairness (see
Matter of Alvarez v Kelly, 2 AD3d 219 [1st Dept 2003]; see also [*2]Matter of Hopper v Kelly, 106 AD3d 530 [1st
Dept 2013]).

We have considered petitioner's remaining arguments and find them unavailing.
Concur—Sweeny, J.P., Andrias, Moskowitz, DeGrasse and Gische, JJ.
