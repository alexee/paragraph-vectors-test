Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Erie County (M. William Boller,
A.J.), rendered March 28, 2012. The judgment convicted defendant, upon his plea of
guilty, of burglary in the second degree.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.

Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon his plea of
guilty of burglary in the second degree (Penal Law § 140.25 [2]). Contrary to
defendant's contention, it is well established that "a 'waiver of the right to appeal [is] not
rendered invalid based on [a] court's failure to require [the] defendant to articulate the
waiver in his [or her] own words' " (People v Ripley, 94 AD3d 1554, 1554 [2012], lv
denied 19 NY3d 976 [2012]; see People v Thompson, 70 AD3d 1319, 1319-1320
[2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 845 [2010], reconsideration denied 15 NY3d
810 [2010]). "[W]e conclude that [defendant's] responses during the plea colloquy and
his execution of a written waiver of the right to appeal establish that he intelligently,
knowingly, and voluntarily waived his right to appeal" (People v Rumsey, 105 AD3d
1448, 1449 [2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 1019 [2013]; see generally People v Lopez,
6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]), and that valid waiver forecloses any challenge by
defendant to the severity of the sentence (see Lopez, 6 NY3d at 255; see
generally People v Lococo, 92 NY2d 825, 827 [1998]; People v Hidalgo, 91
NY2d 733, 737 [1998]).

Defendant contends that his plea should be vacated because it was coerced by
Supreme Court's repeated emphasis on what the potential sentence could be after a trial.
"Although defendant's contention that the plea was not knowingly, voluntarily and
intelligently entered survives the valid waiver of the right to appeal" (People v Garner, 111 AD3d
1421, 1421 [2013]), he "failed to preserve for our review his contention that his
guilty plea was coerced by [the court] inasmuch as he failed to raise that issue in his
motion to withdraw his plea . . . and failed to move to vacate the judgment
of conviction on that ground" (People v Robinson, 64 AD3d 1248, 1248 [2009], lv
denied 13 NY3d 862 [2009]; see People v Carlisle, 50 AD3d 1451, 1452 [2008], lv
denied 10 NY3d 957 [2008]). In any event, defendant's contention lacks merit.
"Although it is well settled that '[a] defendant may not be induced to plead guilty by the
threat of a heavier sentence if he [or she] decides to proceed to trial' . . . ,
the statements of the court at issue . . . 'amount to a description of the range
of the potential sentences' rather than impermissible coercion" (People v Boyde, 71 AD3d
1442, 1443 [2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 747 [2010]). " 'The fact that
defendant may have pleaded guilty to avoid receiving a harsher sentence does not render
his plea coerced' " (id.). Contrary to defendant's further contention, the court did
not err in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea on the ground that defense
counsel coerced him into pleading guilty. " 'The unsupported allegations of defendant
that [defense counsel] pressured him into accepting the plea bargain do not warrant
vacatur of his plea' " (People v
James, 71 AD3d 1465, 1465 [2010]). To the extent that defendant contends that
the plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent because he was on medication at the
time of the plea colloquy, and thus was unable to understand the nature of the
proceedings, that contention " 'is belied by the record of the plea proceeding'
. . . , which establishes that [*2]defendant
understood the nature of the proceedings" (People v Watkins, 107 AD3d 1416, 1417 [2013], lv
denied 22 NY3d 959 [2013]). Present—Smith, J.P., Fahey, Carni, Valentino
and Whalen, JJ.
