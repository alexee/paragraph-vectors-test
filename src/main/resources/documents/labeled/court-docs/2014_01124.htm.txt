	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Pedro Melendez, Appellant.


—[*1]



Robert S. Dean, Center for Appellate Litigation, New York (Carl S. Kaplan of
counsel), for appellant.

Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., District Attorney, New York (Brian R. Pouliot of counsel), for
respondent.



Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Jill Konviser, J.), rendered August 2,
2011, convicting defendant, after a jury trial, of burglary in the first degree and attempted
robbery in the first degree and sentencing him to an aggregate term of 12 years,
unanimously affirmed.

The verdict was not against the weight of the evidence (see People v Danielson, 9
NY3d 342, 348-349 [2007]). There is no basis for disturbing the jury's
determinations concerning identification. The identification testimony was corroborated
by evidence that DNA recovered from the hat left by the intruder at the scene matched
defendant's DNA profile, and we find defendant's explanations for the DNA evidence to
be implausible. To the extent defendant is also challenging the sufficiency of the
evidence as a matter of law, that claim is unpreserved and we decline to review it in the
interest of justice. As an alternative holding, we reject it on the merits. We have
considered and rejected defendant's related claim of ineffective assistance of counsel
(see People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 713-714 [1998]; see also Strickland
v Washington, 466 US 668 [1984]).

The court properly declined to submit third-degree burglary and attempted
third-degree robbery to the jury as lesser included offenses of first-degree burglary and
attempted robbery, since there was no reasonable view of the evidence, viewed most
favorably to defendant, to support such charges. The victims both testified that the
intruder displayed what appeared to be a revolver, and there was no reason for the jury to
selectively discredit only that portion of each victim's testimony (see e.g. People v Davis, 47
AD3d 506, 507 [1st Dept 2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 861 [2008]). Although
there was evidence that defendant was also in possession of a [*2]stick, there was no reasonable view that he committed these
crimes without displaying what appeared to be a firearm.

We perceive no basis for reducing the sentence. Concur—Mazzarelli, J.P.,
Andrias, DeGrasse and Clark, JJ.
