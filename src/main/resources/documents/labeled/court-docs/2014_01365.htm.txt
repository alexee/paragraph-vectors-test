Respondents.


—[*1]


Jahmel Clark, Wallkill, petitioner pro se.

Eric T. Schneiderman, Attorney General, Albany (Peter H. Schiff of counsel), for
respondents.



Proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 (transferred to this Court by order of the
Supreme Court, entered in Albany County) to review two determinations of respondent
Commissioner of Corrections and Community Supervision which found petitioner guilty
of violating certain prison disciplinary rules.

Following an investigation, petitioner was charged in an August 5, 2012 misbehavior
report with extortion. A second misbehavior report dated August 6, 2012 charged
petitioner with possession of contraband, an unhygienic act and a violation of urinalysis
testing procedures after a search of his cell uncovered the finger of a latex glove
containing a substance that appeared to be urine. Following separate tier III disciplinary
hearings, petitioner was found guilty of all charges, with the exception of violating
urinalysis testing procedures, by determinations issued August 10, 2012 and August 15,
2012, respectively. After exhausting his administrative remedies, petitioner commenced
this CPLR article 78 proceeding challenging both determinations.

Initially, respondents concede, and we agree, that the August 10, 2012 determination
stemming from the first misbehavior report must be annulled given the Hearing Officer's
failure to ascertain the reasons for various requested witnesses' refusals to testify. As
such, the determination is annulled, all references expunged from petitioner's institutional
record and any [*2]surcharge in connection with that
determination refunded.

Turning to the August 15, 2012 determination, we find substantial evidence in the
record to support the determination that petitioner possessed contraband in the form of
the misbehavior report and testimony at the hearing, most importantly petitioner's
admissions that he possessed an approved item that had been altered (see Matter of Silverstein v
Bezio, 65 AD3d 1424, 1424-1425 [2009]; Department of Corrections &
Community Supervision Directive No. 4910A [III] [A] [5]). We find that the charge of
committing an unhygienic act—storing urine—must be annulled since we
find merit in petitioner's procedural argument that facility personnel's failure to comply
with Department of Corrections and Community Supervision Directive No. 4910A (VII)
(c) by disposing of the contraband (which had not been tested to confirm that it was
urine) prior to the conclusion of the disciplinary proceeding was relevant to the issue of
whether the liquid in the finger of the latex glove was urine (see Matter of Hodge v Walsh,
92 AD3d 1049, 1050 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 803 [2012]). Since no loss
of good time was recommended, it is not necessary to remit for a redetermination of the
penalty (see Matter of Rivera v
Fischer, 110 AD3d 1277, 1278 [2013]). Petitioner's remaining contentions have
been considered and are without merit.

Lahtinen, J.P., McCarthy, Garry and Rose, JJ., concur. Adjudged that the
determination dated August 10, 2012 is annulled, without costs, petition granted to that
extent and respondent Commissioner of Corrections and Community Supervision is
directed to expunge all references to this matter from petitioner's institutional record.

Adjudged that the determination dated August 15, 2012 is modified, without costs,
by annulling so much thereof as found petitioner guilty of committing an unhygienic act;
respondent Commissioner of Corrections and Community Supervision is directed to
expunge all references to this charge from petitioner's institutional record; and, as so
modified, confirmed.
