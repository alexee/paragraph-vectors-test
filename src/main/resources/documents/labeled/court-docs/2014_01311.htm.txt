	Asnet Springer, Respondent,
v
Washington Mutual
Bank et al., Appellants.


—[*1]



Cullen and Dykman, LLP, New York, N.Y. (Wendy Tobias and Eliza M.
Pugliese of counsel), for appellants.

Phillips, Krantz & Associates, LLP, New York, N.Y. (Heath T. Buzin of counsel),
for respondent.



In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, the defendants appeal from an
order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Solomon, J.), dated May 24, 2012, which
denied their motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.

Ordered that the order is affirmed, with costs.

The Supreme Court properly denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment
dismissing the complaint. A landowner or lessee has a duty to maintain its premises in a
reasonably safe manner (see Peralta v Henriquez, 100 NY2d 139 [2003];
Basso v Miller, 40 NY2d 233 [1976]). Liability can be imposed upon a landowner or
a lessee who creates a dangerous condition on the property, or had actual or constructive
notice of the dangerous condition (see Sanchez v 1710 Broadway, Inc., 79 AD3d 845, 846
[2010]; Gover v Mastic Beach
Prop. Owners Assn., 57 AD3d 729, 730 [2008]). The defendants, who were
lessees of the premises at which the subject accident occurred, failed to demonstrate their
prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law since they did not present
evidence showing that they did not create, or have actual or constructive notice of, the
allegedly dangerous condition that caused the plaintiff's injuries. Thus, the defendants
did not establish their prima facie
entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, and we need not consider the sufficiency of
the plaintiff's opposition to the motion (see Bocelli v County of Nassau, 93 AD3d 747 [2012]; Rosenbaum v Bayis Ne'Emon,
Inc., 32 AD3d 534 [2006]).

In light of the foregoing, we need not reach the plaintiff's remaining contention.
Mastro, J.P., Dickerson, Lott and Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur.
