	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Leroy Howard, Appellant.


—[*1]



Judith E. Permutt, Eastchester, N.Y., for appellant, and appellant pro se.

Janet DiFiore, District Attorney, White Plains, N.Y. (Matthew J. McCarty and Laurie
Sapakoff of counsel), for respondent.


Appeals by the defendant from two judgments of the Supreme Court, Westchester
County (Molea, J.), both rendered October 27, 2011, convicting him of burglary in the
second degree under indictment No. 10-00102 and bail jumping in the second degree
under indictment No. 10-00820, upon his pleas of guilty, and imposing sentences.
Assigned counsel has submitted a brief in accordance with Anders v California
(386 US 738 [1967]), in which she moves for leave to withdraw as counsel for the
appellant.

Ordered that the judgments are affirmed.

We are satisfied with the sufficiency of the brief filed by the defendant's assigned
counsel pursuant to Anders v California (386 US 738 [1967]), and we have also
reviewed the defendant's pro se supplemental brief. Upon an independent review of the
record, we conclude that there are no nonfrivolous issues which could be raised on the
appeals. Counsel's application for leave to withdraw as counsel is, therefore, granted
(see Anders v California, 386 US 738 [1967]; Matter of Giovanni S. [Jasmin
A.], 89 AD3d 252 [2011]; People v Paige, 54 AD2d 631 [1976]; cf.
People v Gonzalez, 47 NY2d 606 [1979]). Skelos, J.P., Lott, Roman and Miller, JJ.,
concur.
