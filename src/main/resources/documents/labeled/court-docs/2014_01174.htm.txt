APPEARANCES OF COUNSEL



Diana Maxfield Kearse, Brooklyn (Mark F. DeWan of counsel), for petitioner.



{**116 AD3d at 59} OPINION OF THE COURT



Per Curiam.

On February 20, 2013, the respondent pleaded guilty to attempted grand larceny in the third degree, in violation of Penal{**116 AD3d at 60} Law §§ 110.00 and 155.35, a class E felony, before the Honorable Norman St. George in the County Court, Nassau County. On March 29, 2013, she was sentenced to a five-year period of probation and restitution in the sum of $14,975.

As alleged in the indictment, the respondent and another person contracted with Parent Workshop, a not-for-profit entity whose purpose is to increase parents' knowledge of the inner workings of the New York City school system, to provide certain consulting services to the organization. The respondent received funds to hire consultants to make outreach visits and conduct workshops for parents. The respondent did not perform the work, but rather kept the funds for herself.

Although served with a copy of this motion, the respondent has neither submitted a response nor requested additional time in which to do so.

By virtue of her felony conviction, the respondent was automatically disbarred and ceased to be an attorney pursuant to Judiciary Law § 90 (4) (a).

Accordingly, the motion of the Grievance Committee for the Second, Eleventh, and Thirteenth Judicial Districts to strike the respondent's name from the roll of attorneys pursuant to Judiciary Law § 90 (4) (b) is granted, to reflect the respondent's automatic disbarment on February 20, 2013.
