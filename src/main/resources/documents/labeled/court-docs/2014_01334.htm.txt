	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Marvin Allen, Appellant.


—[*1]


Lynn W.L. Fahey, New York, N.Y. (Leila Hull of counsel), for appellant.

Kenneth P. Thompson, District Attorney, Brooklyn, N.Y. (Leonard Joblove, Jodi L.
Mandel, Joanna Elm, and Adam Koelsch of counsel), for respondent.



Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County
(Sullivan, J.), rendered October 18, 2011, convicting him of criminal possession of a
weapon in the second degree, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence.

Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.

Contrary to the defendant's contention, the Supreme Court, upon affording the
parties an opportunity to be heard on the matter, did not improvidently exercise its
discretion in permitting the jurors to take the subject gun into the deliberation room
(see CPL 310.20 [1]; People v Ziminski, 34 AD3d 507 [2006]). The defendant
failed to establish that the jury conducted an experiment, let alone an experiment not
within the ken of everyday experience and knowledge concerning a material issue in the
case (see People v
Sturdivant, 6 AD3d 733 [2004]).

The defendant's contention that certain remarks made by the prosecutor during
summation constituted reversible error is unpreserved for appellate review. Defense
counsel either did not object to the remarks at issue or made only a general one-word
objection, and his motion for a mistrial, made after the completion of summations, was
untimely (see People v
Read, 97 AD3d 702 [2012]; People v Malave, 7 AD3d 542 [2004]). In any event, the
contention is without merit. The remarks either were responsive to the defense's
summation, were permissible rhetorical comment, constituted fair comment on the
evidence or the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, or otherwise do not warrant
reversal (see generally People v Halm, 81 NY2d 819 [1993]; People v Wright, 110 AD3d
836 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1045 [2013]; Matter of State of New York v
Colvin M., 110 AD3d 818 [2013]; Matter of State of New York v Carmelo M., 110 AD3d 818
[2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 859 [2014]). Mastro, J.P., Dickerson, Lott and
Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur.
