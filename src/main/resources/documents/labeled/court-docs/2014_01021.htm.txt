	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
George McCrory, Appellant.


—[*1]


Arza Feldman, Uniondale, N.Y. (Steven A. Feldman of counsel), for appellant.

Janet DiFiore, District Attorney, White Plains, N.Y. (Raffaelina Gianfrancesco and
Richard Longworth Hecht of counsel), for respondent.



Appeal by the defendant, by permission, from an order of the Supreme Court,
Westchester County (Lorenzo, J.), entered September 28, 2010, which denied, without a
hearing, his motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 to vacate a judgment of the same court
(Perone, J.) rendered April 19, 2001, convicting him of attempted assault in the second
degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence.

Ordered that the order is affirmed.

The defendant contends that the indictment is jurisdictionally defective because it
failed to provide him with sufficient notice of the accusations against him. However, the
defendant is barred from raising this claim in his motion pursuant to CPL 440.10, as
sufficient facts appear on the record to have permitted adequate review of this claim
upon direct appeal from the underlying judgment, but the defendant unjustifiably failed
to perfect his appeal from that judgment (see CPL 440.10 [2] [c]; People v Cuadrado, 9 NY3d
362, 365 [2007]; People v
Schafer, 94 AD3d 778, 779 [2012]; People v Chiu Mei Lan Kwok, 51 AD3d 814 [2008]). In
this regard, we note that the defendant's direct appeal was dismissed as abandoned in a
decision and order on motion of this Court dated April 28, 2005.

In any event, the alleged defects in the indictment are not jurisdictional and, thus, any
challenge to the sufficiency of the factual allegations in the indictment was waived by the
defendant's plea of guilty (see People v Iannone, 45 NY2d 589, 600 [1978]; People v Cooper, 88 AD3d
1009, 1011 [2011]).

Accordingly, the defendant's motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 was properly denied.
Mastro, J.P., Austin, Sgroi and Miller, JJ., concur.
