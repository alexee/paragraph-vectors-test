respondent.



Appeal from a judgment of the Erie County Court (Michael L. D'Amico, J.),
rendered January 31, 2012. The judgment convicted defendant, upon a nonjury verdict,
of assault in the second degree and harassment in the second degree.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.

Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him following a
nonjury trial of assault in the second degree (Penal Law § 120.05 [1]) and
harassment in the second degree (§ 240.26 [1]). With respect to the assault
conviction, defendant contends that the evidence is legally insufficient to establish that
he intended to cause serious physical injury to one of the victims. We reject that
contention. " 'A defendant may be presumed to intend the natural and probable
consequences of his [or her] actions . . . , and [i]ntent may be inferred from
the totality of conduct of the accused' " (People v Moreland, 103 AD3d 1275, 1276 [2013], lv
denied 21 NY3d 945 [2013]; see People v Meacham, 84 AD3d 1713, 1714 [2011], lv
denied 17 NY3d 808 [2011]). Here, several witnesses testified that defendant
attacked the victim from behind and punched him in the face at least twice with a closed
fist. During the altercation, defendant, who was approximately six feet five inches tall,
weighed about 300 or 320 pounds, and was considerably larger than the victim, placed
the victim in a headlock, and then struck the victim in the face at least once while the
victim was thus immobilized. We conclude that one natural and probable consequence of
striking someone under such circumstances is that the person will sustain a serious
physical injury (see Meacham, 84 AD3d at 1714). Defendant also challenges the
legal sufficiency of the evidence on the issue whether the victim sustained a serious
physical injury within the meaning of Penal Law §§ 120.05 (1) and 10.00
(10). The People presented evidence establishing that the victim sustained two fractures
to his jaw, which required surgery and the permanent placement of a titanium plate in his
chin. The victim's jaw was wired shut for four weeks, and the victim experienced
numbness in his chin that continued until the time of trial. Consequently, we conclude
that the evidence of serious physical injury is legally sufficient to support the conviction
of assault (see People v
Santiago, 111 AD3d 1383, 1384-1385 [2013]; People v Johnson, 50 AD3d
1537, 1537-1538 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 935 [2008]; see also Matter of Tirell R., 33
AD3d 804, 805 [2006]).

Viewing the evidence in light of the elements of the crime and the violation in this
nonjury trial (see People v
Danielson, 9 NY3d 342, 349 [2007]), we reject defendant's further contention
that the court failed to give the evidence the weight it should be accorded when it
determined that he intended to cause serious physical injury (see generally People v
Bleakley, 69 NY2d 490, 495 [1987]), and when it rejected his justification defense
(see People v Moreno, 31
AD3d 1214, 1214 [2006], lv denied 7 NY3d 869 [2006]). "It is well settled
that credibility determinations by the court . . . are entitled to great
deference . . . , and minor inconsistencies in the testimony of certain
prosecution witnesses do not render their testimony incredible as a matter of law" (People v Howard, 101 AD3d
1749, 1750 [2012], lv denied 21 NY3d 944 [2013] [internal quotation marks
omitted]). Present—Smith, J.P., Fahey, Carni, Valentino and Whalen, JJ.
