	In the Matter of East 51st Street Crane Collapse Litigation.
East 51st Street Development Company LLC et al., Respondents,
v
Lincoln
General Insurance Company et al., Defendants, and Axis Surplus Insurance Company,
Appellant.


—[*1]


Hurwitz & Fine, P.C., Buffalo (Dan D. Kohane of counsel), for appellant.

Clyde & Co., US LLP, New York (Paul R. Koeppf of counsel), for
respondents.



Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Carol R. Edmead, J.), entered June 5,
2013, which, in this action for a declaratory judgment, denied defendant AXIS Surplus
Insurance Company's motion for an order declaring: (1) the remaining limit of liability on
the policy of liability insurance issued by it to Reliance Construction Ltd.; and (2) that it
has no further duty to defend or pay defense costs to plaintiffs upon payment of the
declared limit, except to declare that the remaining limit of liability on the policy is
$1,000,000, unanimously affirmed, with costs.

Our determination on the prior appeal (Matter of East 51st St. Crane Collapse Litig., 103 AD3d
401 [2013]), that the ambiguity of whether "expenses" under the policy includes
defense costs must be construed against AXIS, the insured, and that the policy does not
provide for defense within limits, constitutes the law of the case and forecloses
subsequent review of essentially the same issue (see Board of Mgrs. of the 25 Charles St. Condominium v
Seligson, 106 AD3d 130, 135 [1st Dept 2013]). There is no new evidence
requiring additional consideration (Clark Constr. Corp. v BLF Realty Holding Corp., 54 AD3d
604, 604 [1st Dept 2008]). We note, however, that our conclusion on the prior
appeal conveys a continuing obligation on the part of AXIS to defend plaintiff East 51st
Street, regardless of whether such defense expenses exceed the policy limit. Accordingly,
the motion court's finding that no amounts incurred in the defense of East 51st Street
eroded the policy limits comports with [*2]our prior
ruling.

We have considered AXIS' additional arguments and find them unavailing.
Concur—Tom, J.P., Friedman, Saxe, Richter and Clark, JJ.
