	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Crushawn Hundley, Appellant.


—[*1]


Lynn W.L. Fahey, New York, N.Y. (Mark W. Vorkink of counsel), for
appellant.

Richard A. Brown, District Attorney, Kew Gardens, N.Y. (John M. Castellano and
Jeanette Lifschitz of counsel; Lorrie A. Zinno on the brief), for respondent.


Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Queens County
(Blumenfeld, J.), rendered August 8, 2012, convicting him of robbery in the third degree,
criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, and criminal possession of stolen
property in the fifth degree, after a nonjury trial, and imposing sentence.

Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution (see People v
Contes, 60 NY2d 620 [1983]), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the
defendant's guilt of robbery in the third degree and criminal possession of a weapon in
the third degree beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, in fulfilling our responsibility to
conduct an independent review of the weight of the evidence (see CPL 470.15
[5]; People v Danielson, 9
NY3d 342 [2007]), we nevertheless accord great deference to the factfinder's
opportunity to view the witnesses, hear the testimony, and observe demeanor (see
People v Mateo, 2 NY3d 383, 410 [2004], cert denied 542 US 946 [2004];
People v Bleakley, 69 NY2d 490, 495 [1987]). Upon reviewing the record here,
we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt on those counts was not against the weight of the
evidence (see People v
Romero, 7 NY3d 633 [2006]). Rivera, J.P., Leventhal, Austin and Roman, JJ.,
concur.
