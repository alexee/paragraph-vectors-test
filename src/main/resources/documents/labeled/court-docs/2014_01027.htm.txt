v
Jayson M. Kelley, Appellant.


—[*1]



Frank H. Hiscock Legal Aid Society, Syracuse (Philip Rothschild of counsel),
for defendant-appellant.

William J. Fitzpatrick, District Attorney, Syracuse (Maria Maldonado of counsel),
for respondent.



Appeal from a judgment of the Onondaga County Court (Anthony F. Aloi, J.),
rendered June 3, 2010. The judgment convicted defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of
burglary in the first degree and robbery in the first degree.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously reversed on
the law, the plea is vacated, and the matter is remitted to Onondaga County Court for
further proceedings on the indictment.

Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon his plea of
guilty of burglary in the first degree (Penal Law § 140.30 [2]) and robbery in the
first degree (§ 160.15 [3]). Pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, County
Court imposed concurrent, determinate terms of incarceration of 20 years. Defendant
contends that the court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea on the
ground that it was coerced by the court's statements concerning the potential terms of
incarceration in the event that he was convicted following a trial. We agree with
defendant that "the court's statements do not amount to a description of the range of
potential sentences but, rather, they constitute impermissible coercion, 'rendering the plea
involuntary and requiring its vacatur' " (People v Flinn, 60 AD3d 1304, 1305 [2009]; see
People v Fanini, 222 AD2d 1111, 1111 [1995]). In light of our decision, we do not
address defendant's remaining contentions. Present—Scudder, P.J., Smith, Centra,
Carni and Whalen, JJ.
