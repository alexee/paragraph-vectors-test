v
David Gelia,
Appellant.


—[*1]


John P. Pieri, Buffalo, for defendant-appellant.

Palmer, Murphy & Tripi, Buffalo (Thomas A. Palmer of counsel), for
plaintiff-respondent.



Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Erie County (John F. O'Donnell, J.),
entered November 16, 2012 in a divorce action. The order directed defendant to pay
attorney's and accountant's fees of plaintiff.

It is hereby ordered that the order so appealed from is unanimously affirmed without
costs.

Memorandum: Defendant appeals from an order directing him to pay counsel fees in
the amount of $20,475 and accountant's fees in the amount of $11,115 as his share of
such fees incurred by plaintiff in this matrimonial action. We reject defendant's
contention that those awards are excessive. "The award of reasonable . . .
fees is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court" (Morrissey v
Morrissey, 259 AD2d 472, 473 [1999]; see Domestic Relations Law §
237 [a]). Supreme Court properly considered the parties' submissions in light of all the
circumstances of the case, including the parties' relative financial circumstances and the
merits of their positions during settlement negotiations, and we conclude that the awards
are reasonable and do not constitute an abuse or improvident exercise of the court's
discretion (see Decker v
Decker, 91 AD3d 1291, 1291-1292 [2012]; Blake v Blake, 83 AD3d 1509, 1509 [2011] [appeal No.
1]). Present—Scudder, P.J., Fahey, Lindley and Sconiers, JJ.
