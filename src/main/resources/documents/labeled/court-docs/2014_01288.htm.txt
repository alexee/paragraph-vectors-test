v
Lynch Park, LLC,
Respondent, et al., Defendants.


—[*1]



Boris Kogan, New York, N.Y. (David Binson of counsel), for appellant.

Wenig Saltiel LLP, Brooklyn, N.Y. (Meryl L. Wenig and Scott F. Loffredo of
counsel), for respondent.



In an action, inter alia, to recover damages for breach of contract and to confirm an
arbitration award, the plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings
County (Bunyan, J.), entered February 4, 2013, which granted the cross motion of the
defendant Lynch Park LLC for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as
asserted against it.

Ordered that the order is affirmed, with costs.

The Supreme Court properly granted the cross motion of the defendant Lynch Park,
LLC (hereinafter the respondent) for summary judgment dismissing the complaint
insofar as asserted against it. The respondent established, prima facie, that it did not enter
into a contract with the plaintiff for the sale of any property owned by it and, thus, the
respondent was entitled to judgment as a matter of law dismissing the plaintiff's breach
of contract, unjust enrichment, and specific performance causes of action (see
Winegrad v New York Univ. Med. Ctr., 64 NY2d 851, 853 [1985]; Zuckerman v
City of New York, 49 NY2d 557, 559 [1980]). Moreover, with respect to the cause
of action to confirm an arbitration award, the respondent established its prima facie
entitlement to judgment as a matter of law by proving that it was not a signatory to the
arbitration agreement and, thus, was not a proper party to the arbitration (see Matter of Jalas v Halperin,
85 AD3d 1178, 1182 [2011]). In opposition, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable
issue of fact as to any of the causes of action (see Alvarez v Prospect Hosp., 68
NY2d 320, 324 [1986]).

The plaintiff's remaining contentions are without merit. Dillon, J.P., Balkin,
Chambers and Cohen, JJ., concur.
