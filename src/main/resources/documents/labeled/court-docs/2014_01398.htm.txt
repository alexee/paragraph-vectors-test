Respondent.


—[*1]


Claire B. Chico, P.C., New York (Claire B. Chico of counsel), for appellant.

The Edelsteins, Faegenburg & Brown LLP, New York (Adam J. Edelstein of
counsel), for respondent.

Karen Freedman, Lawyers for Children, Inc., New York (Shirim Nothenberg of
counsel), attorney for the child.


Appeal from order, Family Court, New York County (Jody Adams, J.), entered on or
about October 16, 2012, which dismissed the petition to change custody and modified
the visitation provisions of the parties' amended judgment of divorce, unanimously
dismissed, without costs, as taken from a nonappealable paper.

No appeal lies from the order since it was entered upon petitioner's default in
appearing at the hearing to determine whether the change in custody she requested was
warranted (see CPLR 5511; Matter of Anthony M.W.A. [Micah W.A.], 80 AD3d 476
[1st Dept 2011]). Concur—Mazzarelli, J.P., Acosta, Renwick, Freedman and
Manzanet-Daniels, JJ.
