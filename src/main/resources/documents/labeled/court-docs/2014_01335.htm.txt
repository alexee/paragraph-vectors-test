	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Robert Baley, Appellant.


—[*1]


Lynn W.L. Fahey, New York, N.Y. (Barry Stendig of counsel), for appellant.

Richard A. Brown, District Attorney, Kew Gardens, N.Y. (John M. Castellano and
Merri Turk Lasky of counsel; Andrew Dykens on the memorandum), for
respondent.



Appeal by the defendant, as limited by his motion, from a sentence of the Supreme
Court, Queens County (Kron, J.), imposed January 25, 2011, upon his plea of guilty, on
the ground that the sentence was excessive.

Ordered that the sentence is affirmed.

A defendant who has validly waived the right to appeal cannot invoke this Court's
interest of justice jurisdiction to obtain a reduced sentence (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d
248, 255 [2006]). Here, however, the Court is not precluded from exercising its
interest of justice jurisdiction because the defendant's purported waiver of his right to
appeal was invalid. The record does not demonstrate that the defendant "grasped the
concept of the appeal waiver and the nature of the right he was forgoing" (People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d
257, 267 [2011]; see
People v Grant, 83 AD3d 862, 862-863 [2011]; cf. People v Ramos, 7 NY3d
737, 738 [2006]). Therefore, "notwithstanding the written appeal waiver form, it
cannot be said that defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to
appeal" (People v Bradshaw, 18 NY3d at 267; see People v Elmer, 19 NY3d
501, 510 [2012]; People v
Vasquez, 101 AD3d 1054 [2012]).

Nevertheless, the sentence imposed was not excessive (see People v Suitte,
90 AD2d 80 [1982]). Eng, P.J., Mastro, Dickerson, Lott and Miller, JJ., concur.
