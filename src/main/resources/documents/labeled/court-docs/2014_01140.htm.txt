respondent.



Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Saliann Scarpulla, J.), entered October
22, 2012, which denied plaintiffs' motion to vacate so much of a conference discovery
order that ruled that defendant was not required to produce two specified claims files and
to compel defendant to produce those files and any claims file arising under the excess
insurance policy at issue, unanimously reversed, on the law and the facts, without costs,
and the motion granted.

Plaintiffs seek a declaration that defendant is obligated to indemnify them in an
underlying personal injury action. Defendant contends, among other things, that
plaintiffs failed to provide timely notice of the occurrence. Under Ohio law, which
governs the issue of timely notice in this case (see 95 AD3d 556 [1st Dept
2012]), if it is determined that their notice was untimely, then plaintiffs will bear the
burden of rebutting the consequent presumption of prejudice to defendant (see
Ferrando v Auto-Owners Mut. Ins. Co., 98 Ohio St 3d 186, 208, 781 NE2d 927, 947
[2002]).

Plaintiffs seek to rebut the presumption by establishing, inter alia, that, as an excess
insurer, defendant would not have become more involved in the handling of the
underlying action had it received notice at an earlier time. The requested claims files may
shed light on defendant's excess claims handling practices and policies during the
pertinent time period by showing the actions that defendant took when it received timely
notice of claims arising under the same excess policy. Therefore, the requested files are
material and necessary to plaintiffs' prosecution of this case (see Clarendon Natl. Ins. Co. v
Atlantic Risk Mgt., Inc., 59 AD3d 284 [1st Dept 2009]; CPLR 3101 [a]).

Plaintiffs' demand was not overbroad or unduly burdensome, since it specifically
sought claims files arising during the relevant time period under the excess policy at
issue in this case. Moreover, defendant's counsel represented to the court that "there
weren't a lot of claims files," and defendant's ready access to these files is demonstrated
by the fact that the files were the source of two documents it has already produced.

In any event, plaintiffs' need for the discovery outweighs any special burden to be
borne [*2]by defendant (see Andon v 302-304 Mott
St. Assoc., 94 NY2d 740, 746 [2000]). Defendant represented to the motion court
that it was unable to locate the bulk of its records pertaining to plaintiffs' named insured.
Furthermore, defendant has not produced a witness with first-hand knowledge of its
excess handling practices during the applicable time period.

Since defendants did not move for a protective order, and plaintiffs' demand was not
" 'palpably improper,' " the motion court was precluded from denying plaintiffs' motion
on the basis of unspecified "privacy" concerns (see Zurich Ins. Co. v State Farm Mut.
Auto. Ins. Co., 137 AD2d 401, 401-402 [1988]). Concur—Mazzarelli, J.P.,
