	In the Matter of Dustin JJ., a Child Alleged to Be
Abandoned. Broome County Department of Social Services, Respondent; Clyde KK.,
Appellant.


—[*1]


Bruce E. Knoll, Albany, for appellant.

Albert Aaron, Broome County Department of Social Services, Binghamton, for
respondent.

F. Daniel Casella, Binghamton, attorney for the child.



Egan Jr., J. Appeal from an order of the Family Court of Broome County
(Charnetsky, J.), entered December 4, 2012, which granted petitioner's application, in a
proceeding pursuant to Social Services Law § 384-b, to adjudicate Dustin JJ. to be
an abandoned child, and terminated respondent's parental rights.

The child who is the subject of this proceeding, Dustin JJ., was placed in petitioner's
custody shortly after his birth in 2010. In July 2011, respondent was declared to be
Dustin's father and, in August 2011, Dustin's mother executed a judicial surrender of her
parental rights. Thereafter, in February 2012, petitioner commenced this proceeding
alleging that respondent had abandoned the child. Following a fact-finding hearing,
Family Court adjudicated Dustin to be an abandoned child and terminated respondent's
parental rights. Respondent now appeals.

We affirm. "A finding of abandonment is warranted when it is established by clear
and convincing evidence that the parent failed to visit or communicate with the child or
the [*2]petitioning agency during the six-month period
immediately prior to the filing of the petition" (Matter of Lamar LL. [Loreal MM.], 86 AD3d 680, 680
[2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 712 [2011] [citations omitted]; see Matter of Ryan Q. [Eric
Q.], 90 AD3d 1263, 1263-1264 [2011], lv denied 18 NY3d 809 [2012];
Matter of Gabriel D. [Andrea
D.], 68 AD3d 1505, 1506 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 703 [2010]). In
this regard, "[a] parent's ability to maintain contact with his or her child is
presumed—including a parent who is incarcerated" (Matter of Ryan Q. [Eric
Q.], 90 AD3d at 1264; accord Matter of Maria E. [Jermaine D.], 94 AD3d 1357,
1358 [2012])—and once the parent's failure to maintain contact is established, the
burden shifts to the parent "to prove an inability to maintain contact or that he or she was
prevented or discouraged from doing so by the petitioning agency" (Matter of Erving BB. [Lynette
EE.], 111 AD3d 1102, 1103 [2013] [internal quotation marks and citation
omitted]; see Matter of Jazmyne
OO. [Maurice OO.], 111 AD3d 1085, 1086 [2013]; Matter of Jamal B. [Johnny
B.], 95 AD3d 1614, 1615 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 812 [2012]).
Notably, in the context of an abandonment proceeding, the petitioning agency "is not
required to prove that it exercised diligent efforts to reunite the family or assist the parent
in maintaining contact" (Matter of Erving BB. [Lynette EE.], 111 AD3d at
1103-1104; see Matter of Maria E. [Jermaine D.], 94 AD3d at 1358; Matter
of Lamar LL. [Loreal MM.], 86 AD3d at 681).

As Family Court correctly concluded, the relevant six-month period ran from August
26, 2011 to February 26, 2012. Although respondent, who was incarcerated from
October 30, 2011 to December 23, 2011, testified that he visited with Dustin on a total of
four occasions after he was declared to be the child's father, the record reflects that at
least two of these visits occurred outside of the statutory period. Indeed, according to
petitioner's caseworker, the foster mother and the social worker who supervised the
visitations, respondent visited the child only once during the six months at issue.

As to other forms of contact, the foster mother testified that although she received
one or two phone calls from respondent inquiring about the child, the child did not
receive any cards, letters, gifts or emails from respondent during the relevant period.
According to petitioner's caseworker, respondent called her on three occasions between
October 2011 and February 2012; during two of those phone calls, respondent expressed
the desire for a bus pass. Such sporadic and insubstantial contacts are, in our view,
insufficient to defeat petitioner's showing of abandonment (see Matter of Jamal B.
[Johnny B.], 95 AD3d at 1615-1616; Matter of Ryan Q. [Eric Q.], 90 AD3d
at 1264; Matter of Leon CC.
[Larry CC.], 86 AD3d 764, 765 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 714
[2011]). To the extent that respondent testified that he contacted the child's foster parents
"quite a few times to see how Dustin [was]," Family Court expressly found respondent
not to be credible, and its determination on this point is entitled to deference (see
Matter of Leon CC. [Larry CC.], 86 AD3d at 766). Finally, respondent failed to
demonstrate that either his incarceration or his allegedly limited access to a telephone "so
permeated his life as to make contact with his child[ ] or petitioner during the relevant
time period infeasible" (Matter of Jamal B. [Johnny B.], 95 AD3d at 1616
[internal quotation marks and citation omitted]), and his present assertion—that
petitioner prevented or discouraged contact with his child—is belied by the record.
Accordingly, we discern no basis upon which to disturb Family Court's finding of
abandonment.

Respondent's remaining contentions do not warrant extended discussion. To the
extent that respondent argues that Family Court improperly curtailed his
cross-examination of petitioner's caseworker, we note that the "scope and manner [of
cross-examination] are [matters] left to the sound discretion of the trial court" (Salm v Moses, 13 NY3d
816, 817 [2009]; see [*3]Matter of Shane MM. v
Family & Children Servs., 280 AD2d 699, 701 [2001]) and, based upon our review
of the testimony, we perceive no abuse of that discretion here. As for Family Court's
decision to forgo a dispositional hearing, "a dispositional hearing is not required where
abandonment is established" (Matter of Mahogany Z. [Wayne O.], 72 AD3d 1171, 1173
[2010], lv denied 14 NY3d 714 [2010]; see Matter of Chantelle TT., 281
AD2d 660, 662 [2001]) and, in any event, we cannot say that Family Court abused its
discretion in dispensing with such a hearing in this matter. Finally, even assuming that
respondent had requested that Family Court impose a suspended judgment, this Court
recently concluded that "[t]he only statutorily authorized disposition after a finding of
abandonment is an order committing the child's custody to [the] petitioner; a suspended
judgment is not an option" (Matter of Erving BB. [Lynette EE.], 111 AD3d at
1104). Accordingly, respondent is not entitled to the relief he now seeks.

McCarthy, J.P., Garry and Rose, JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is affirmed,
without costs.
