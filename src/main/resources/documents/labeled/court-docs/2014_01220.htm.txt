Garry, J. Appeal from an order of the Family Court of Otsego County (Lambert, J.),
entered September 27, 2012, which granted petitioner's application, in a proceeding
pursuant to Family Ct Act article 6, for custody of the parties' children.

Petitioner (hereinafter the mother) and respondent (hereinafter the father) are the
parents of two children (born in 2006 and 2007). In January 2012, the mother
commenced this proceeding in Family Court seeking an award of sole custody on the
basis that the father had not seen or supported the children since 2008. Both parties
attended the initial appearance in March 2012 and requested assigned counsel. The court
scheduled a pretrial conference to occur in April 2012 and advised the parties in person
and in writing of the date. Upon the father's unexplained failure to appear for the April
conference, the court scheduled a fact-finding hearing and Lincoln hearing, and
issued written notice to the parties, their counsel and the attorney for the children
informing them that the matter was adjourned until August 10, 2012. On that date, the
father again did not appear. His assigned counsel requested an adjournment, stating that
the father had encountered transportation difficulties. The mother and the attorney for the
children opposed the adjournment, and Family Court denied the request. Following a
Lincoln hearing with the older child and a fact-finding hearing in which the
mother was the sole witness, the court granted the mother's request for sole custody and
suspended the father's right of visitation until such time as [*2]he petitioned for this relief. Rather than seeking such a
remedy in Family Court, the father appeals.[FN1]


The father first contends that Family Court erred in declining to adjourn the hearing.
The determination of whether to grant a request for an adjournment is entrusted to the
sound discretion of the trial court, and it will not be disturbed unless that discretion is
clearly abused (see Matter of
Steven B., 6 NY3d 888, 889 [2006]). While the father lived a significant
distance away, he had been advised of the hearing date more than four months before, in
a notice warning that no oral requests for adjournment would be granted and that his
failure to appear could be treated as a default. His previous failure to appear for the April
2012 conference had frustrated the efforts of counsel, the mother and court personnel to
resolve the matter promptly, and by the time of his second failure to appear, the mother's
custody petition had been pending for over eight months. Considering the allegations that
the father had previously been wholly uninvolved in the children's lives for several years,
we do not find it unreasonable to view his failure to attend two consecutive court
proceedings as part of a continuing pattern. We cannot say that the court improvidently
exercised its discretion in refusing to delay the matter further (see Matter of Braswell v
Braswell, 80 AD3d 827, 829 [2011]; Matter of Cukerstein v Wright, 68 AD3d 1367, 1368
[2009]; Matter of Heyer v Heyer, 112 AD2d 539, 540 [1985]).

The father next contends that Family Court erred in suspending his right to visitation.
As he asserts, visitation with a noncustodial parent is presumed to be in a child's best
interests and should not be denied in the absence of substantial proof that contact would
be harmful to the child's welfare (see Matter of VanBuren v Assenza, 110 AD3d 1284, 1284
[2013]; Matter of Culver v
Culver, 82 AD3d 1296, 1297 [2011], appeal dismissed 16 NY3d 884
[2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 710 [2011]). Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals has
recently clarified that the standard of substantial proof "should not be interpreted in such
a way as to heighten the burden, of the party who opposes visitation, to rebut the
presumption . . . by a preponderance of the evidence" (Matter of Granger v Misercola,
21 NY3d 86, 92 [2013]). To meet this burden, the opposing party must demonstrate
by sworn testimony or documentary evidence that visitation would be harmful to the
child or that the noncustodial parent has forfeited the right of access (see id. at
91-92).

Here, the mother testified that she has continuously resided with the children at the
same address that she shared with the father before he left the household in 2008.
Thereafter, the mother has acted as the children's sole caretaker and, although she stated
that she "left the door open" for the father to visit, he made brief visits only once or twice
and allegedly never provided child support.[FN2]

The mother testified that she does not have current contact information for the father,
knows nothing about his circumstances or living situation and, thus, does not wish the
children to leave her home to visit with him. She expressed qualified willingness for him
to visit the children at her residence, but also stated that she was "not sure" if this was
advisable because of her concern that forced contact with a person who the children did
not know might be harmful [*3]to them. At the
conclusion of the hearing, both the attorney for the children and the mother's counsel
asked the court not to order visitation unless and until the father demonstrated an interest
in developing his relationship with the children by applying for such relief.

A noncustodial parent's failure to avail himself or herself of opportunities for
visitation over a lengthy period of time is appropriately taken into account in considering
whether visitation is appropriate, especially where, as here, the parent is "essentially a
stranger to the child[ren]" (Matter of Cole v Comfort, 63 AD3d 1234, 1236 [2009],
lv denied 13 NY3d 706 [2009]; see Matter of Butler v Ewers, 78 AD3d 1667, 1667 [2010];
Matter of Dantzler v
McKane, 48 AD3d 937, 938-939 [2008], lv denied 10 NY3d 709
[2008]; Matter of Bougor v Murray, 283 AD2d 695, 695-696 [2001]). Without
breaching the older child's confidentiality, we note that Family Court made searching
efforts during the Lincoln hearing to ascertain the extent of her familiarity with
the father, her willingness to have contact with him and whether her attitude toward him
had been improperly influenced. Significantly, the record does not reveal that the father
has ever petitioned for visitation, and even after the mother initiated this proceeding, he
neither filed a cross petition nor provided any other affirmative indication, through his
counsel or otherwise, of what form of contact he wished to have or his plan for obtaining
it.

Finally, we note that Family Court's order was, in effect, a temporary remedy that did
not absolutely foreclose the father's visitation, but instead expressly anticipated that he
would initiate contact by petitioning for such relief. It is most unfortunate that, rather
than availing himself of this opportunity, the father chose to bring this matter for review
on appeal. In light of all of the circumstances—in particular, the dearth of
evidence in the record that might have provided the court with a sound and substantial
basis for a visitation order—we find that the requirement for the father to petition
strikes an appropriate balance between his right to an "opportunity to establish a
meaningful relationship with [the children]" and his previous failure to do so (Matter of Russell v Simmons,
88 AD3d 1080, 1081 [2011]). As Family Court's decision is supported by a sound
and substantial basis in the record, it will not be disturbed (see Matter of Joshua SS. v Amy
RR., 112 AD3d 1159, 1159 [2013]; Matter of Brown v Terwilliger, 108 AD3d 1047, 1048
[2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 858 [2013]; Matter of Heyer v Heyer, 112
AD2d at 540).

Peters, P.J., Lahtinen and Rose, JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is affirmed,
without costs.


Footnotes




Footnote 1: The father's brief does
not address the custody award; thus, any issues pertaining to that aspect of Family Court's
order are deemed abandoned (see Matter of Timothy N. v Gwendolyn N., 92 AD3d 1155,
1156 n [2012]).




Footnote 2: No testimony was
elicited on this point, which was alleged in the mother's petition.
