v
Roger Cole, Appellant.


—[*1]


Lynn W.L. Fahey, New York, N.Y. (De Nice Powell of counsel), for appellant,
and appellant pro se.

Kenneth P. Thompson, District Attorney, Brooklyn, N.Y. (Leonard Joblove, Thomas
M. Ross, and Claibourne Henry of counsel), for respondent.



Appeal by the defendant from a resentence of the Supreme Court, Kings County
(Marrus, J.), imposed January 20, 2012, pursuant to the Drug Law Reform Act of 2004
(L 2004, ch 738), the resentence being five determinate terms of imprisonment of 20
years to be followed by a five-year period of postrelease supervision on each of those
terms, upon his convictions, after a jury trial, of criminal sale of a controlled substance in
the first degree (five counts), with those terms of imprisonment to run consecutively to
each other and concurrently with an indeterminate term of imprisonment of
11/3 to 4 years previously imposed by judgment of the same court rendered
July 7, 1992, upon his conviction of criminal sale of a firearm in the second degree.

Ordered that the resentence is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of
justice, by reducing the resentence imposed from five determinate terms of imprisonment
of 20 years followed by a five-year period of postrelease supervision on each of those
terms to five determinate terms of imprisonment of 15 years followed by a five-year
period of postrelease supervision on each of those terms.

In 1992, the defendant was convicted, after a jury trial, of five counts of criminal sale
of a controlled substance in the first degree (see Penal Law § 220.21), and
one count of criminal sale of a firearm in the second degree (see Penal Law
§ 265.11). The defendant was sentenced to five indeterminate terms of
imprisonment of 25 years to life for the convictions of criminal sale of a controlled
substance in the first degree and one indeterminate term of imprisonment of
11/3 to 4 years for the conviction of criminal sale of a firearm in the second
degree. The terms of imprisonment for the convictions of criminal sale of a controlled
substance in the first degree were directed to run consecutively to each other and
concurrently with the term of imprisonment imposed for the conviction of criminal sale
of a firearm in the second degree, for a total aggregate term of imprisonment of 125 years
to life.

In 2011, the defendant moved to be resentenced pursuant to the Drug Law Reform
Act of 2004 (L 2004, ch 738, § 23; hereinafter the DLRA). The Supreme Court
granted the [*2]defendant's motion to the extent of
resentencing him, for the five convictions of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the
first degree, to five determinate terms of imprisonment of 20 years, to run consecutively
to each other and concurrently with the sentence originally imposed on the conviction of
criminal sale of a firearm in the second degree, for a total aggregate determinate term of
imprisonment of 100 years. The defendant appeals, contending that the resentence is
excessive and that the Supreme Court should have resentenced him, for the convictions
of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, to five determinate terms of
imprisonment of 15 years. The defendant also contends, in his pro se supplemental brief,
that the Supreme Court should have directed that the resentences should run concurrently
with each other.

The general purpose of the DLRA was to provide ameliorative relief by reducing the
sentences of eligible individuals who were sentenced under the relatively higher
mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment dictated by the indeterminate sentencing
scheme of the Rockefeller Drug Laws (see People v Yusuf, 19 NY3d 314, 320 [2012]; People v Sosa, 18 NY3d
436, 438 [2012]; People v
Utsey, 7 NY3d 398, 401 [2006]; People v Lashley, 83 AD3d 868, 869 [2011]). Accordingly,
when the Legislature enacted the DLRA in 2004, it "eliminated the mandatory minimum
15-year to life sentences for class A-I drug offenders (see Penal Law former
§ 70.00 [2] [a]; [3] [a] [i]), . . . and replaced the indeterminate
sentencing structure with determinate sentences" (People v Duke, 40 AD3d 872, 873 [2007]; see
Penal Law §§ 70.00 [1]; 70.71; People v Utsey, 7 NY3d at
401). The DLRA also contained a provision which allowed individuals convicted of a
class A-I felony committed before the effective date of the new law to move for
resentencing in accordance with the new determinate sentencing scheme (see L
2004, ch 738, § 23 [eff Dec. 27, 2004]).

Here, the defendant sought to be resentenced for the convictions of criminal sale of a
controlled substance in the first degree, for which he had originally received consecutive
sentences amounting to a total aggregate term of imprisonment of 125 years to life.
Although the Supreme Court correctly observed that it was powerless, under the DLRA,
to alter the defendant's sentence so that the five terms of imprisonment imposed for the
convictions of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree run concurrently
with each other (see People v
Norris, 20 NY3d 1068, 1072 [2013]; People v Acevedo, 14 NY3d 828, 830-831 [2010]; People v Rodriguez, 96 AD3d
1079, 1080 [2012], affd 20 NY3d 1073 [2013]; People v Vaughan, 62 AD3d
122 [2009]), it was nevertheless permitted to "consider any facts or circumstances
relevant to the imposition of a new sentence" (L 2004, ch 738, § 23; see People v Karim, 85 AD3d
943, 943-944 [2011]). Accordingly, under the circumstances, in evaluating the
appropriate terms of imprisonment to impose upon resentencing, the Supreme Court
should have considered the fact that the sentences that were originally imposed for the
convictions of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree were directed to
run consecutively to each other (accord People v Nelson, 112 AD3d 744 [2013]; People v Jaquez, 34 AD3d
598 [2006]). Here, since the resentences imposed by the Supreme Court were
required to run consecutively with each other, the total aggregate term of imprisonment
for the convictions of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree still
amounted to 100 years in prison.

"An intermediate appellate court has broad, plenary power to modify a sentence that
is unduly harsh or severe under the circumstances" (People v Delgado, 80 NY2d
780, 783 [1992], citing CPL 470.15 [6] [b]; People v Thompson, 60 NY2d 513,
519 [1983]). This authority to substitute its discretion for that of the sentencing court is
necessary "to rectify sentencing disparities [and] reach extraordinary situations"
(People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80, 86 [1982]).

Under the circumstances of this case, including the fact that the courts are
constrained from giving effect to the ameliorative purpose of the DLRA by directing
resentences to run concurrently with each other when they were originally directed to run
consecutively (see People v Norris, 20 NY3d at 1072; People v Acevedo,
14 NY3d at 830-831; People v
Vaughan, 62 AD3d 122 [2009]), we conclude that the resentence imposed was
excessive to the extent indicated (see generally People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80
[1982]). Mastro, J.P., Austin, Sgroi and Miller, JJ., concur.
