	Vidyasagar Lingechetty, Respondent,
v
Geeta
Shukla et al., Appellants.


—[*1]


Michael H. Zhu, Esq., P.C., New York, N.Y., for appellants.

Marvin S. Robbins, Garden City, N.Y., for respondent.



In an action to recover damages for fraud, unjust enrichment, and breach of contract,
the defendants appeal from (1) an order of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (Driscoll,
J.), dated February 28, 2012, which denied the motion of the defendant Geeta Shukla
pursuant to CPLR 4404 (a) to set aside a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff and against
her on the causes of action alleging fraud and unjust enrichment, and for judgment as a
matter of law, and (2) a judgment of the same court dated May 7, 2012, which, upon the
jury verdict and the order, is in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant Geeta
Shukla in the principal sum of $390,500.

Ordered that the appeal from the order is dismissed; and it is further,

Ordered that the appeal by the defendants Shyam Shukla and All Season Restaurant
Group, Inc., from the judgment is dismissed, as they are not aggrieved thereby
(see CPLR 5511); and it is further,

Ordered that the judgment is affirmed on the appeal by the defendant Geeta Shukla,
that branch of the motion of the defendant Geeta Shukla which was pursuant to CPLR
4404 (a) to set aside the jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff on the cause of action
alleging fraud and for judgment as a matter of law on that cause of action is granted, and
the order is modified accordingly; and it is further,

Ordered that one bill of costs is awarded to the plaintiff.

The appeal from the intermediate order must be dismissed because the right of direct
appeal therefrom terminated with the entry of judgment in the action (see Matter of
Aho, 39 NY2d 241, 248 [1976]). The issues raised on the appeal from the order are
brought up for review and have been considered on the appeal from the judgment
(see CPLR 5501 [a] [1]).

"Before granting a motion pursuant to CPLR
4404 (a) to set aside a verdict and for judgment as a matter of law, the trial court must
conclude that there is simply no valid line of reasoning and permissible inferences which
could possibly lead rational [people] to the conclusion reached by the jury on the basis of
the evidence at trial" (Michael
H. Spector, AIA, P.C. v Billy Smith's Sport Ctr., Inc., 95 AD3d 967, 967 [2012]
[internal quotation marks omitted]; see Cohen v Hallmark Cards, 45 NY2d 493,
499 [1978]). Here, there is no valid line of reasoning or permissible inferences that could
lead a rational person to the conclusion reached by the jury with respect to the cause of
action alleging fraud. "The elements of a cause of action for fraud require a material
misrepresentation of a fact, knowledge of its falsity, an intent to induce reliance,
justifiable reliance by the plaintiff and damages" (Eurycleia Partners, LP v Seward & Kissel, LLP, 12 NY3d
553, 559 [2009]). Contrary to the contention of the defendant Geeta Shukla, the
record contains proof of scienter (see Brown v Lockwood, 76 AD2d 721,
731-732 [1980]). However, having admitted at trial that he failed to read a document that
would have alerted him to a major discrepancy between the oral and written
representations made to him, the plaintiff failed to establish the element of justifiable
reliance (see Shalam v KPMG
LLP, 89 AD3d 155, 159 [2011]; Maines Paper & Food Serv. v Adel,
256 AD2d 760, 761-762 [1998]; 88 Blue Corp. v Reiss Plaza Assoc., 183 AD2d
662, 664 [1992]; see also Lewin Chevrolet-Geo-Oldsmobile v Bender, 225
AD2d 916, 918 [1996]). Accordingly, the Supreme Court erred in denying that branch of
Geeta Shukla's motion which was to set aside the verdict and for judgment as a matter of
law with respect to the fraud cause of action (see Giurdanella v Giurdanella, 226
AD2d 342, 343 [1996]).

The Supreme Court properly denied that branch of Geeta Shukla's motion which was
to set aside the verdict and for judgment as a matter of law on the cause of action
alleging unjust enrichment. The evidence presented at trial demonstrated that Geeta
Shukla was enriched at the plaintiff's expense, and that it would be against equity and
good conscience to permit her to retain this benefit without compensating the plaintiff
(see Michael H. Spector, AIA, P.C. v Billy Smith's Sport Ctr., Inc., 95 AD3d at
968). Geeta Shukla's contention that the plaintiff is precluded from recovering based on
an unjust enrichment theory because a contract governs the relevant subject matter is
unpreserved for appellate review (see Myers v Schaffer Grocery Corp., 281
AD2d 156, 157 [2001]).

In light of our determination, we need not address Geeta Shukla's remaining
contention with respect to the fraud cause of action. Skelos, J.P., Lott, Cohen and
Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur.
