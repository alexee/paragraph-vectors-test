	Patricia Rojas-Wassil, Respondent,
v
Altagracia
Villalona et al., Appellants.


—[*1]


Gannon, Rosenfarb, Balletti & Drossman, New York (Lisa L. Gokhulsingh of
counsel), for appellants.

Worby Groner Edelman, LLP, White Plains (Michael G. Del Vecchio of counsel),
for respondent.



Order, Supreme Court, Bronx County (Alexander W. Hunter, Jr., J.), entered May
31, 2013, which, insofar as appealed from, denied defendants' motion for summary
judgment dismissing plaintiff's negligence cause of action, unanimously reversed, on the
law, without costs, and the motion granted. The Clerk is directed to enter judgment
dismissing the complaint.

Dismissal of the negligence cause of action is warranted in this case where plaintiff,
a parole officer, was injured when, while on defendants' property to arrest defendant
Pena, she twisted and hyperextended her knee while climbing over a chain-link fence in
the rear of defendants' property. Defendants had no duty to ensure that the fence was safe
for adults to climb (see Koppel v Hebrew Academy of Five Towns, 191 AD2d
415 [2d Dept 1993], lv denied 82 NY2d 652 [1993]), and no evidence was
presented that the defects in the fence noted by plaintiff's expert were a substantial factor
in plaintiff's accident.

Although defendants raised the arguments concerning duty and proximate cause for
the first time on appeal, legal issues appearing on the face of the record which could not
have been [*2]avoided may be reviewed by this Court for
the first time on appeal (see
Vanship Holdings Ltd. v Energy Infrastructure Acquisition Corp., 65 AD3d
405, 408 [1st Dept 2009]). Concur—Sweeney, J.P., Renwick, Moskowitz,
Richter and Gische, JJ.
