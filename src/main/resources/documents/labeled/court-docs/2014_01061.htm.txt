counsel), for defendant-appellant.

Frank A. Sedita, III, District Attorney, Buffalo (Nicholas T. Texido of counsel), for
respondent.



Appeal from a judgment of the Erie County Court (Kenneth F. Case, J.), rendered
April 19, 2012. The judgment convicted defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of driving
while intoxicated, a class E felony (three counts).

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously modified on
the law by reversing that part convicting defendant of count three of the superior court
information, vacating the plea with respect to that count and dismissing that count, and as
modified the judgment is affirmed.

Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon his plea of
guilty of three counts of felony driving while intoxicated (felony DWI) (Vehicle and
Traffic Law §§ 1192 [3]; 1193 [1] [c] [i]), arising from three separate
incidents. Defendant was initially arraigned in local court on two separate felony
complaints charging him with, inter alia, felony DWI for two incidents occurring in
August and September 2011. Defendant was subsequently charged in a third felony
complaint with one count of aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in the
first degree (AUO1) (§ 511 [3] [a] [i]) for an incident occurring in October 2011.
Defendant thereafter executed a written waiver of indictment and agreed to be prosecuted
by a superior court information (SCI). The SCI charged defendant with three counts of
felony DWI, i.e., one count for each incident. Defendant pleaded guilty to all three
counts, and waived his right to appeal.

As a preliminary matter, we reject defendant's contention that his waiver of the right
to appeal is unenforceable. Contrary to defendant's contention, his waiver of the right to
appeal was knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently entered (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d
248, 256 [2006]), and that valid waiver encompasses his challenge to the severity of
the sentence (see id. at 255-256).

As the People correctly concede, however, the third count of felony DWI in the SCI
is jurisdictionally defective pursuant to CPL 195.20 because defendant was not held for
action of the grand jury on that charge, nor is it a joinable offense pursuant to that statute
or case law. We therefore modify the judgment accordingly. Initially, "[w]e note that
defendant's contention that the SCI is jurisdictionally defective does not require
preservation, and that contention survives defendant's valid waiver of the right to appeal"
(People v Stevenson, 107
AD3d 1576, 1576 [2013]). The third count of felony DWI is jurisdictionally
defective because it " 'was not an offense charged in the [third] felony complaint or a
lesser-included offense of an offense charged in th[at] felony complaint' " (People v Cieslewicz, 45 AD3d
1344, 1345 [2007]). Furthermore, although the third count of felony DWI charged in
the SCI is joinable, within the meaning of CPL 200.20 (2) (a), to the charge on which
defendant was held for action of a grand jury, i.e., the AUO1 charge in the third felony
complaint, "[t]he language of CPL 195.20 makes clear that where 'joinable' offenses are
included, the [SCI] must, at a minimum, also include at least one offense that was
contained in the felony complaint" at issue (People v Zanghi, 79 NY2d 815, 818
[1991]). Present—Smith, J.P., Fahey, Carni, Valentino and Whalen, JJ.
