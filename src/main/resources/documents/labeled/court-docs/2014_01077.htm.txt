v
David Perry, Respondent.


—[*1]


Brooks T. Baker, District Attorney, Bath (John C. Tunney of counsel), for
appellant.

John M. Scanlon, Binghamton, for defendant-respondent.



Appeal from an order of the Steuben County Court (Joseph W. Latham, J.), entered
November 28, 2012. The order granted that part of defendant's omnibus motion seeking
to dismiss the indictment.

It is hereby ordered that the order so appealed from is unanimously reversed on the
law, that part of the motion seeking to dismiss the indictment is denied, the indictment is
reinstated, and the matter is remitted to Steuben County Court for further proceedings on
the indictment.

Memorandum: On appeal from an order granting that part of defendant's omnibus
motion seeking to dismiss the indictment pursuant to CPL 30.10 (2) (b), the People
contend that County Court erred in determining that the statute of limitations had
expired. We agree. Defendant was charged by an indictment with grand larceny in the
second degree based on the theory that he stole in excess of $50,000 in New York State
retirement disability benefits to which he was not entitled. Defendant applied for those
benefits in 2004 or 2005, and received payments from February 17, 2005 through
February 28, 2012.

It is well settled that the People may aggregate "a series of single larcenies governed
by a common fraudulent scheme or plan even though the successive takings extended
over a long period of time" (People v Rosich, 170 AD2d 703, 703 [1991], lv
denied 77 NY2d 1000 [1991]; see People v Cox, 286 NY 137, 142-143
[1941], rearg denied 286 NY 706 [1941]; People v Tighe, 2 AD3d 1364, 1365 [2003], lv
denied 2 NY3d 747 [2004]). The offense of grand larceny as alleged in this case is
therefore properly characterized as a continuing crime (see People v First Meridian
Planning Corp., 86 NY2d 608, 615-616 [1995]), and "the [s]tatute of [l]imitations of
a continuous crime is governed by the termination and not the starting date of the
offense" (People v Eastern Ambulance Serv., 106 AD2d 867, 868 [1984]; see People v DeBeer, 35 AD3d
1275, 1276 [2006], lv denied 8 NY3d 921 [2007]). The statute of limitations
in this case did not begin to run until the final taking in February 2012 (see generally People v
Randall-Whitaker, 55 AD3d 931, 931 [2008], lv denied 12 NY3d 787
[2009]), and the prosecution commenced shortly thereafter in March 2012 was thus
timely pursuant to CPL 30.10 (2) (b).

Defendant contends that the statute of limitations began to run at the time of the
allegedly fraudulent filing, relying on People v O'Boyle (136 Misc 2d 1010,
1012-1013 [1987]). That case, however, is inapposite inasmuch as the defendant in that
case was charged with insurance fraud, whereas defendant in this case is charged with
grand larceny. Present—Centra, J.P., Peradotto, Lindley, Sconiers and Whalen, JJ.
