v
Carroll B.
Lesesne, M.D., et al, Appellants.


—[*1]


Martin Clearwater & Bell LLP, New York (Arjay G. Yao of counsel), for
appellants.

Evans and Al-Shabazz, LLP, New York (Robert Anthony Evans, Jr. of counsel), for
respondent.



Order, Supreme Court, Bronx County (Stanley Green, J.), entered April 23, 2013,
which denied defendants' motion to change venue from Bronx County to New York
County, unanimously affirmed, without costs.

The motion court providently exercised its discretion in denying defendants' motion
to change venue as untimely. The record shows that defendants had the facts necessary to
seek a change of venue several years in advance of the time their motion was made and
that they did not provide a reasonable explanation for their delay in seeking the venue
change (see e.g. Romero v St.
Anthony Community Hosp., 96 AD3d 532 [1st Dept 2012]; Mena v Four
Wheels Co., 272 AD2d 223 [1st Dept 2000]). Concur—Mazzarelli, J.P.,
Acosta, Renwick, Freedman and Manzanet-Daniels, JJ.
