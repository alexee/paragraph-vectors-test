	The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Michele McLawrence, Appellant.


—[*1]


Lynn W.L. Fahey, New York, N.Y. (Allegra Glashausser of counsel), for
appellant, and appellant pro se.

Kenneth P. Thompson, District Attorney, Brooklyn, N.Y. (Leonard Joblove and
Diane R. Eisner of counsel), for respondent.


Motion by the respondent, in effect, for leave to reargue an appeal from a judgment
of the Supreme Court, Kings County, rendered September 16, 2010, which was
determined by decision and order of this Court dated July 3, 2013 (108 AD3d 571
[2013]).

Upon the papers filed in support of the motion and no papers having been filed in
opposition or in relation thereto, it is

Ordered that the motion is granted and, upon reargument, the decision and order of
this Court dated July 3, 2013, is recalled and vacated, and the following decision and
order is substituted therefor:

Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (J.
Goldberg, J.), rendered September 16, 2010, convicting him of attempted murder in the
second degree, assault in the first degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the second
degree, and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, upon a jury verdict, and
imposing sentence.

Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.

The defendant was arrested for shooting the complainant, his former friend, outside
the apartment building where the defendant resided and where the complainant formerly
resided with his aunt. The complainant testified that after the defendant shot him, the
defendant ran into that apartment building. When the police arrived, the complainant
identified the defendant's apartment number for one of the officers. When one of the
officers went to the roof of the apartment building, he saw the defendant stick his head
out of a window and throw out a silver handgun, which subsequently was recovered from
the courtyard outside the building. The police secured a search warrant for the
defendant's apartment and recovered, inter alia, a sawed-off shotgun and a .9 mm pistol
from a duffle bag in the defendant's apartment. Neither the shotgun nor the pistol was
linked to the defendant by DNA or other forensic evidence.
[*2]
At trial, the complainant testified that the
defendant shot at him several times from three or four feet away, and that he was struck
by one bullet in the forearm when he raised his arms to protect himself. The complainant
further testified that he believed the reason the defendant shot him was because the
complainant had told people in the neighborhood that the defendant was a "snitch" after
the police raided the apartment where the complainant lived with his aunt. In addition to
having the bullet removed, a week after the shooting the complainant underwent surgery
to repair his injured forearm, which had an unstable fracture and required the insertion of
permanent plates and pins to stabilize it.

The defendant was convicted of attempted murder in the second degree, assault in
the first degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, and criminal
possession of a weapon in the third degree relating to the shotgun retrieved from the
duffle bag in the defendant's apartment.

The defendant's challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting his
conviction of attempted murder in the second degree is unpreserved for appellate review
(see CPL 470.05 [2]; People v Finger, 95 NY2d 894, 895 [2000];
People v Gray, 86 NY2d 10, 19-21 [1995]; People v Betts, 292 AD2d
539, 540 [2002]). In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the
prosecution (see People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620, 621 [1983]), we find that it was
legally sufficient to establish the defendant's guilt of attempted murder in the second
degree beyond a reasonable doubt (see People v Soto, 8 AD3d 683, 684-685 [2004]).
Moreover, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt on that count was not against the
weight of the evidence (see
People v Romero, 7 NY3d 633 [2006]). Notwithstanding the fact that only one
bullet struck the complainant, the jury could reasonably infer that the defendant intended
to kill, rather than merely frighten, the complainant by repeatedly shooting him at close
range (see Penal Law §§ 110.00, 125.25 [1]; People v Lewis, 72 AD3d
705, 706 [2010]; People v
Santana, 70 AD3d 448 [2010]; People v Hall, 242 AD2d 734, 735
[1997]).

The defendant's contention, in effect, that the evidence was legally insufficient to
support his conviction of assault in the first degree is unpreserved for appellate review
(see CPL 470.05 [2]; People v Hawkins, 11 NY3d 484, 492 [2008]; People v Serrano, 74 AD3d
1104, 1105 [2010]). In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable
to the prosecution (see People v Contes, 60 NY2d at 621), we find that it was
legally sufficient to establish the defendant's guilt of that crime beyond a reasonable
doubt. Moreover, upon our independent review pursuant to CPL 470.15 (5), we are
satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence (see People v Danielson, 9
NY3d 342, 348 [2007]; People v Romero, 7 NY3d 633 [2006]). Contrary to the
defendant's contention, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the complainant
sustained a serious physical injury within the meaning of Penal Law § 10.00 (10)
(see CPL 120.10 [1]; People v Kern, 75 NY2d 638, 658 [1990], cert
denied 498 US 824 [1990]; People v Moreno, 233 AD2d 531, 532 [1996]).

The sentence imposed was not excessive (see People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80
[1982]).

The defendant's remaining contentions, including the contentions raised in his pro se
supplemental brief, are not preserved for appellate review and, in any event, are without
merit. Rivera, J.P., Dillon, Dickerson and Austin, JJ., concur.
