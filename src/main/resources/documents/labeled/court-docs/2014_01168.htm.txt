	In the Matter of Pearl Boatwright, Deceased. Janice Clark,
Appellant-Respondent; Stanley Boatwright,
Respondent-Appellant.


—[*1]


Villani & Galette, P.C., Brooklyn, N.Y. (Helen Z. Galette of counsel), for
appellant-respondent.

Michael F. Mongelli II, P.C., Flushing, N.Y. (Hope A. Achiron of counsel), for
respondent-appellant.



In a turnover proceeding pursuant to SCPA 2103 to recover certain property on
behalf of a decedent's estate, Janice Clark appeals, as limited by her brief, from so much
of a decree of the Surrogate's Court, Kings County (Lopez Torres, S.), dated March 7,
2012, as, upon an order of the same court dated October 15, 2007, made after a hearing,
determining that certain real property was not an asset of the estate, and upon an
amended decision of the same court dated October 21, 2011, made after a nonjury trial,
determining that the proceeds of two bank accounts were assets of the estate, granted the
amended petition to the extent of directing Janice Clark to pay the principal sum of
$51,968.43, and the petitioner cross-appeals, as limited by his brief, from so much of the
same decree as directed Janice Clark to pay to him individually, rather than to the estate,
the principal sum of only $51,968.43.

Ordered that the decree is modified, on the law, by deleting the provision thereof
directing Janice Clark to pay to the petitioner individually the principal sum of
$51,968.43, and substituting therefor a provision directing Janice Clark to pay the
principal sum of $103,936.86 to the decedent's estate; as so modified, the decree is
affirmed insofar as appealed and cross-appealed from, with costs to the petitioner.

The decedent died on November 16, 1998, at the age of 88. She was survived by two
children, Stanley Boatwright and Janice Clark, each entitled to 50% of her estate.
Boatwright was granted limited letters of administration pursuant to SCPA 2103 to
discover assets of the estate. In such capacity, he commenced this proceeding alleging
that Clark was in possession of assets of the estate, including (1) $45,000 in withdrawals
from the decedent's Dime Savings account held in trust for Clark and Boatwright; (2)
$58,936.86, representing the decedent's share of proceeds of her sister's estate, which
were deposited into the decedent's Roslyn Savings account held in trust for Clark; and (3)
real property on MacDonough Street in Brooklyn (hereinafter the premises).

In her answer to the amended petition, Clark relied, in part, on a general release
executed by Boatwright on November 25, 1998, releasing any claim to the premises in
exchange for $55,000. After a hearing on the validity of the release and an additional
renunciation executed by [*2]Boatwright on the same
day, the Surrogate's Court, by order dated October 15, 2007, determined that the release
was valid and denied Boatwright's claim for turnover of the premises to the estate.

Boatwright's remaining claims concerning the subject bank accounts proceeded to
trial. After trial, the Surrogate's Court determined that the disputed funds were rightfully
assets of the estate, and granted the amended petition to the extent of directing Clark to
turn over half of the wrongfully withheld funds to Boatwright individually. Clark
appeals. Boatwright cross-appeals from so much of the decree as directed Clark to pay to
him individually the principal sum of only $51,968.43.

In its order dated October 15, 2007, the Surrogate's Court properly denied
Boatwright's claim for the turnover of the premises to the estate. "Generally, 'a valid
release constitutes a complete bar to an action on a claim which is the subject of the
release' " (Centro Empresarial
Cempresa S.A. v AmÉrica MÃ³vil, S.A.B. de C.V., 17 NY3d 269, 276
[2011], quoting Global Mins. &
Metals Corp. v Holme, 35 AD3d 93, 98 [2006]). A release may, however, be
invalidated for any of the traditional bases for setting aside written agreements, such as
duress, fraud, or mutual mistake, with the burden on the party seeking to invalidate the
release (see Centro Empresarial Cempresa S.A. v AmÉrica MÓvil,
S.A.B. de C.V., 17 NY3d at 276). Contrary to Boatwright's contention, he failed to
establish that the release was procured by fraud or undue influence based upon, among
other things, a previous transfer of the premises to Clark without Boatwright's
knowledge. "[I]t is not a prerequisite to the enforceability of a release that the releasor be
subjectively aware of the precise claim he or she is releasing" (Mergler v Crystal
Props. Assoc., 179 AD2d 177, 180 [1992]; see Liling v Segal, 220 AD2d
724 [1995]). Moreover, the evidence revealed that Boatwright negotiated the terms of the
release and knowingly and voluntarily released any claim to the premises in exchange for
consideration. His failure to consult with an attorney does not preclude enforcement of
the release (see Skluth v United Merchants & Mfrs., 163 AD2d 104, 107 [1990]).

The Surrogate's Court properly determined that Clark wrongfully withheld from the
estate the funds in the subject Dime Savings account and Roslyn Savings account,
totaling $103,936.86. Generally, the burden of proving undue influence rests with the
party asserting its existence (see
Hearst v Hearst, 50 AD3d 959, 962 [2008]; Matter of Connelly, 193
AD2d 602 [1993]). However, if a confidential relationship exists, the burden is shifted to
the beneficiary of the transaction to prove by clear and convincing evidence "that the
transaction was fair, open, voluntary, and well understood, and therefore free from undue
influence" (Campbell v
Campbell, 50 AD3d 614, 615 [2008]; see Matter of Gordon v Bialystoker
Ctr. & Bikur Cholim, 45 NY2d 692, 698 [1978]; Oakes v Muka, 69 AD3d 1139 [2010]).

Here, Clark had a fiduciary relationship with the decedent in relation to the
decedent's subject bank accounts by virtue of powers of attorney she held for those
accounts (see Matter of
Ferrara, 7 NY3d 244, 254 [2006]; Matter of Audrey Carlson Revocable Trust, 59 AD3d 538
[2009]; Semmler v Naples, 166 AD2d 751 [1990]; Moglia v Moglia, 144
AD2d 347 [1988]). Thus, a presumption of impropriety attaches to the withdrawals from
the decedent's Dime Savings account, in light of Clark's deposits of those funds into her
own checking account on the same dates as the withdrawals (see Mantella v
Mantella, 268 AD2d 852 [2000]; Matter of Roth, 283 AD2d 504 [2001]).
Moreover, a confidential relationship existed at the time of the October 2, 1998, deposit
of the proceeds from the estate of the decedent's sister into the decedent's Roslyn Savings
account held in trust for Clark, by virtue of the fact that the decedent was then
homebound and reliant upon Clark for her daily needs (see Matter of Connelly,
193 AD2d 602 [1993]; Hennessey v Ecker, 170 AD2d 650 [1991]). The
Surrogate's Court credited Boatwright's testimony on this issue, and that credibility
determination is to be accorded great weight (see Matter of Coviello, 57 AD3d 662, 663 [2008]). This
deposit into an account held in trust for Clark, made mere weeks before the decedent's
death, is subject to the same presumption of impropriety as it would be had Clark taken
such funds directly (see Matter of Audrey Carlson Revocable Trust, 59 AD3d at
540; Matter of Clinton, 1 Misc 3d 913[A], 2004 NY Slip Op 50056[U] [Sur Ct,
NY County 2004]).

Clark failed to meet her burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that
the decedent intended to make a gift or loan to her of the subject funds and that the
transactions were "fair, open, voluntary, and well understood, and therefore free from
undue influence" (Campbell v [*3]Campbell, 50
AD3d at 615; see Mantella v Mantella, 268 AD2d 852 [2000]). The Surrogate's
Court found Clark's explanations of the transactions evasive, dissembling, and incredible,
and the court's credibility determination is to be accorded great weight (see Matter of
Coviello, 57 AD3d at 663). We find no basis to disturb the determination of the
Surrogate's Court that the subject funds are rightfully assets of the estate.

However, the Surrogate's Court erred in directing Clark to pay half of the wrongfully
withheld funds to Boatwright in his individual capacity. Boatwright commenced this
proceeding in his capacity as limited administrator of the decedent's estate, seeking
turnover of the disputed assets to the estate, and therefore, the wrongfully withheld funds
must be returned to the estate for administration (cf. Matter of O'Connell, 98 AD3d 673 [2012]).
Accordingly, we modify the decree to direct Clark to pay the full amount of the
wrongfully withheld funds to the estate, for subsequent distribution to the parties as
beneficiaries of the estate. Balkin, J.P., Chambers, Lott and Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur.
