Co., Respondent, et al., Defendants.


—[*1]


Anderson Kill P.C., New York (Jeffrey E. Glen of counsel), for appellant.

Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, New York (Randy M. Mastro of counsel), for
respondent.



Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Barbara R. Kapnick, J.), entered June
25, 2012, dismissing the complaint with prejudice, unanimously affirmed, without costs.
Appeal from order, same court and Justice, entered June 12, 2012, unanimously
dismissed, without costs, as subsumed in the appeal from the judgment.

Defendant contends that New York City Zoning Resolution § 12-10 bars all of
plaintiff's claims because it excludes "floor space used for mechanical equipment" from
"floor area." However, the Zoning Resolution does not define "floor space used for
mechanical equipment" (cf. Matter of Raritan Dev. Corp. v Silva, 91 NY2d 98,
101 [1997] [Zoning Resolution defines "cellar space," which is also excluded from "floor
area"]). An engineer employed by the New York City Department of Buildings has
opined that "floor space for housing telephone switching equipment for business
operation and not for the building's mechanical system . . . will not qualify
for mechanical space and therefore should not be exempt from zoning floor area."
However, this is not a final agency determination. Thus, the motion court correctly found
that the definition of floor space used for mechanical equipment "demands administrative
determination in the first instance" (2012 NY Slip Op 51142[U], *6 [2012]).

The court correctly dismissed the first through fourth causes of action (fraud and
negligent misrepresentation) because plaintiff did not establish justifiable reliance, due to
its failure to use ordinary intelligence to ascertain the truth of defendant's representations
(see e.g. Centro Empresarial
Cempresa S.A. v AmÉrica Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V., 17 NY3d 269, 278-279
[2011]; 1537 Assoc. v Kaprielian Enters., 259 AD2d 447 [1st Dept 1999]). This
rule is not limited to parties that are contracting for the first time (see Centro, 17
NY3d at 272-274, 278-279). Assuming, arguendo, that plaintiff is not a sophisticated
investor, it cites no precedential authority for the proposition that only sophisticated
investors have a duty to investigate.

Unlike DDJ Mgt., LLC v
Rhone Group L.L.C. (15 NY3d 147 [2010]) and CIFG Assur. N. [*2]Am., Inc. v Goldman, Sachs & Co. (106 AD3d
437 [1st Dept 2013]), on which plaintiff relies, the case at bar does not involve a
written representation, as plaintiff concedes (see ACA Fin. Guar. Corp. v Goldman, Sachs & Co., 106 AD3d
494, 494, 496 [1st Dept 2013], appeal dismissed 22 NY3d 909 [2013]; HSH Nordbank AG v UBS
AG, 95 AD3d 185, 198 n 9 [1st Dept 2012]).

We turn now to the contract claims. In the parties' July 31, 2007 deed, plaintiff
conveyed certain property to defendant. In the contemporaneous Zoning Lot
Development and Easement Agreement (ZLDA), defendant conveyed certain property to
plaintiff. Since the deed did not cover conveyances from defendant to
plaintiff, section 2 (b) of the ZLDA, in which defendant conveyed 246,407
square feet of floor area to plaintiff, did not merge into the deed (see Schoonmaker v
Hoyt, 148 NY 425, 429-430 [1896]). Section 6 (a) of the ZLDA, in which defendant
agreed not to sell any of plaintiff's 246,407 square feet of floor area, did not merge into
the deed because that obligation could not be performed until after the conveyance
(see White v Long, 204 AD2d 892, 894 [3d Dept 1994], mod on other
grounds 85 NY2d 564 [1995]). By contrast, the 1972 agreement in which plaintiff
agreed to sell defendant the real estate at issue, as amended in 2007, merged into the
deed.

Plaintiff contends that the 1972 contract contained obligations collateral to the
transfer of real property. However, the amount of floor space allotted to defendant is not
a collateral matter but an aspect of the conveyance of property from plaintiff to defendant
that is related to the nature or extent of the property to be conveyed (see Novelty Crystal Corp. v PSA
Institutional Partners, L.P., 49 AD3d 113, 117 [2d Dept 2008]; see also
Cordua v Guggenheim, 274 NY 51, 57 [1937]).

Plaintiff also contends that the 1972 agreement contained obligations that the parties
intended to continue after the deed was issued. However, while the 1972 contract
provides that various sections constitute covenants running with the land, it does not say
that the limitations on the size of defendant's building will run with the land (see 527
Smith St. Brooklyn Corp. v Bayside Fuel Oil Depot Corp., 262 AD2d 278 [2d Dept
1999]).

The fraud exception to the merger doctrine (see Woodworth v Delgrand, 174
AD2d 1011 [4th Dept 1991]) does not apply because plaintiff's fraud claims were
correctly dismissed.

In its present state, the amended complaint does not specify which provisions of the
ZLDA defendant breached; hence, the ninth cause of action (for breach of the ZLDA)
was correctly dismissed (see
767 Third Ave. LLC v Greble & Finger, LLP, 8 AD3d 75 [1st Dept 2004];
Kraus v Visa Intl. Serv. Assn., 304 AD2d 408 [1st Dept 2003]).

Contrary to defendant's contention, plaintiff is not equitably estopped from suing
defendant for breach of the ZLDA (see Nassau Trust Co. v Montrose Concrete Prods.
Corp., 56 NY2d 175, 184 [1982]).

The court correctly dismissed the fifth and sixth causes of action, for unjust
enrichment with respect to the Overbuilt Zoning Space (as defined in the complaint), as
duplicative of plaintiff's contract claims (see e.g. IDT Corp. v Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., 12
NY3d 132, 142 [2009]). The whole concept of Overbuilt Zoning Space depends on
the contracts. The complaint alleges, "Upon information and belief, the Verizon Building
exceeds the Floor Area contractually and legally allocated and available to
Verizon (such excess Floor Area utilized by the Verizon Building is referred to as the
'Overbuilt Zoning Space')" (emphasis added).

Plaintiff contends that its unjust enrichment claims should not have been dismissed
as [*3]duplicative of its contract claims because it was
fraudulently induced into entering the various contracts between itself and defendant.

However, we have found that plaintiff's fraud claims were correctly dismissed.
