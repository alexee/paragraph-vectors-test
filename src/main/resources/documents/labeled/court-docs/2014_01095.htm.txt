Gorman, Waszkiewicz, Gorman & Schmitt, Utica (William P. Schmitt of
counsel), for defendant-appellant.

Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Oneida County (Bernadette T. Clark,
J.), entered July 9, 2012. The order, inter alia, granted that part of the motion of plaintiffs
for an order adjudging defendant in contempt for violating orders from 1981 and 1982;
granted the cross motion of plaintiffs seeking summary judgment on the complaint and
seeking dismissal of the counterclaims; and denied the cross motion of defendant for
summary judgment dismissing the complaint.

It is hereby ordered that the order so appealed from is unanimously modified on the
law by denying plaintiffs' motion in its entirety and vacating the first and second ordering
paragraphs, and denying that part of plaintiffs' cross motion seeking summary judgment,
and plaintiffs are directed to join as parties Forestport Fire Fighters, Inc. and Woodgate
Volunteer Fire Department, Inc., and as modified the order is affirmed without costs.

Memorandum: Defendant owns a parcel of vacant land situated in Oneida County
between White Lake and Route 28 that includes an area known as Beach A. Plaintiffs
own property within a 400-acre tract adjacent to White Lake. By virtue of certain
covenants, restrictions, and easements running in their favor, plaintiffs enjoy rights of
access to White Lake over Beach A. Plaintiffs commenced the instant action after
defendant erected a structure on Beach A. Plaintiffs alleged, inter alia, that the structure
violates covenants prohibiting the erection or maintenance of a fence without their
written consent, and the obstruction of any established roads or trails without their
permission. Plaintiffs further alleged that the structure violates their rights of access to
White Lake over Beach A. According to defendant, it erected a gate, not a fence, on
Beach A, and it denied that the gate obstructs any roads or trails or impairs plaintiffs'
rights of access to White Lake.

In appeal No. 1, defendant appeals from an order that, inter alia, granted that part of
plaintiffs' motion seeking an order adjudging defendant in contempt for violating orders
from 1981 and 1982 concerning Beach A; granted plaintiffs' cross motion seeking
summary judgment on the causes of action in the complaint and, specifically, removal of
the structure, and seeking dismissal of defendant's counterclaims; and denied defendant's
cross motion seeking summary judgment dismissing the complaint. In appeal No. 2,
defendant appeals from a judgment awarding attorney fees and expenses to plaintiffs.

We reject defendant's contention in appeal No. 1 that Supreme Court erred in
denying its cross motion inasmuch as we conclude that defendant failed to establish its
entitlement to judgment as a matter of law (see generally CPLR 3212 [b]). We
agree with defendant, however, that the court erred in granting that part of plaintiffs'
motion seeking an order adjudging defendant in contempt of the 1981 and 1982 orders.
We therefore modify the order in appeal No. 1 accordingly. "To succeed on a motion to
punish for civil contempt, the moving party must show that the alleged contemnor
violated a clear and unequivocal court order and that the violation prejudiced a right of a
party to the litigation" (Giano v
Ioannou, 41 AD3d 427, 427 [2007]; see Judiciary Law § 753 [A]
[3]). "Contempt should not be granted unless the order or judgment allegedly violated is
clear and explicit and unless the act complained of is clearly proscribed" (Aison v Hudson Riv. Black Riv.
Regulating Dist., 54 AD3d 457, 458 [2008]). Here, neither of the prior orders
contains a clear mandate proscribing the erection of the structure at issue, and plaintiffs
failed to establish that defendant's conduct prejudiced their rights (see Ketchum v
Edwards, 153 NY 534, 539-540 [1897]). In view of that determination, we further
conclude that the court erred in granting that part of plaintiffs' cross motion seeking
summary judgment on the third cause of action, which alleges that defendant is in
violation of the 1981 and 1982 orders. We therefore further modify the order in appeal
No. 1 accordingly. Inasmuch as the court's finding of contempt is erroneous, we conclude
that plaintiffs are not entitled to attorney fees flowing from defendant's allegedly
contemptuous conduct, and we therefore vacate the judgment in appeal No. 2 awarding
such fees (see Moore v
Davidson, 57 AD3d 862, 863 [2008]).

We further agree with defendant in appeal No. 1 that the court erred in granting that
part of plaintiffs' cross motion seeking summary judgment on the first cause of action,
which alleges that defendant violated the covenants prohibiting erection and maintenance
of a fence and obstruction of established roads or trails, and the second cause of action,
which alleges that defendant interfered with plaintiffs' rights of access to White Lake.
The law favors the free and unrestricted use of real property, and therefore covenants
restricting such use are strictly construed against those seeking to enforce them (see
Huggins v Castle Estates, 36 NY2d 427, 430 [1975]; Ludwig v Chautauqua Shores
Improvement Assn., 5 AD3d 1119, 1120 [2004], lv denied 3 NY3d 601
[2004]). Plaintiffs, as the parties seeking to enforce the covenants at issue, were required
to "prove, by clear and convincing evidence, the scope . . . of the
restriction" (Greek Peak v Grodner, 75 NY2d 981, 982 [1990]). In addition,
"where the language used in a restrictive covenant is equally susceptible of two
interpretations, the less restrictive interpretation must be adopted" (Ludwig, 5
AD3d at 1120). Viewing the language of the covenants in light of those rules, we
conclude that plaintiffs failed to establish that the structure erected by defendant violates
the covenant prohibiting erection or maintenance of a fence (see generally
Huggins, 36 NY2d at 430; Liebowitz v Forman, 22 AD3d 530, 531 [2005]). We
further conclude that plaintiffs failed to establish that the structure violates the covenant
prohibiting the obstruction of established trails or roads or otherwise interferes with
plaintiffs' rights of access to White Lake (see Sargent v Brunner Hous. Corp., 31
AD2d 823, 823-824 [1969], affd 27 NY2d 513 [1970]; Mester v Roman, 25 AD3d
907, 908 [2006]; see generally Lewis v Young, 92 NY2d 443, 449-450
[1998]). Rather, triable issues of fact remain whether the covenants at issue were
intended to prohibit the structure in question and thus whether defendant violated those
covenants (see Brill v Brill, 108 NY 511, 516 [1888]; Birch Tree Partners, LLC v
Windsor Digital Studio, LLC, 95 AD3d 1154, 1156 [2012]; Melrose
Waterway v Peacock, 229 AD2d 1000, 1001 [1996]). We therefore further modify
the order in appeal No. 1 accordingly.

We agree with defendant with respect to appeal No. 1 that Forestport Firefighters,
Inc. (Forestport) and Woodgate Volunteer Fire Department, Inc. are necessary parties to
this action by virtue of the easement across Beach A that was granted to Forestport for
firefighting purposes in the 1982 order (see CPLR 1001 [a]; Loree v Barnes, 59 AD3d
965, 965 [2009]; Hitchcock v Boyack, 256 AD2d 842, 844 [1998]). We
therefore further modify the order in appeal No. 1 by directing plaintiffs to join those
parties to this action (see
Sorbello v Birchez Assoc., LLC, 61 AD3d 1225, 1226 [2009]; Dunkin Donuts of N.Y., Inc. v
Mid-Valley Oil Co., Inc., 14 AD3d 590, 592 [2005]). Finally, we note that
defendant raises no contentions in its brief concerning that part of the order granting
plaintiffs' cross motion to the extent that it sought dismissal of the counterclaims, and
thus defendant has abandoned any such contentions (see Ciesinski v Town of
Aurora, 202 AD2d 984, 984 [1994]). Present—Scudder, P.J., Centra, Carni,
Sconiers and Whalen, JJ.
