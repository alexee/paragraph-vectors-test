—[*1]


Jaan Aarismaa, IV, petitioner-appellant pro se.

Harris Beach PLLC, Ithaca (Mark B. Wheeler of counsel), for
respondent-respondent.



Appeal from an order of the Surrogate's Court, Seneca County (Dennis F. Bender,
S.), dated August 31, 2012. The order, inter alia, denied the motion of petitioner to
vacate a judgment and decree entered in October 2011 and enjoined petitioner from
bringing further pro se applications in this estate matter without the approval of
Surrogate's Court.

It is hereby ordered that the order so appealed from is unanimously affirmed with
costs and the matter is remitted to Surrogate's Court, Seneca County, for further
proceedings in accordance with the following.

Memorandum: Petitioner appeals from an order that, inter alia, denied his motion
pursuant to CPLR 5015 (a) to vacate a judgment and decree entered in October 2011 and
enjoined petitioner from bringing any further pro se applications in this estate matter
without the approval of Surrogate's Court. The judgment and decree, inter alia, granted
the motion of respondent, the executor of decedent's estate, for summary judgment
dismissing the petition. We affirm.

Petitioner contends that the Surrogate should have granted his motion because the
judgment and decree was procured through "fraud, misrepresentation, or other
misconduct of an adverse party," and because the Surrogate "lack[ed] . . .
jurisdiction to render" the judgment and decree (CPLR 5015 [a] [3], [4]). Both of those
contentions are based on petitioner's position that respondent's motion for summary
judgment dismissing the petition was premature because issue had not been joined and a
note of issue had not been filed. We reject both contentions. CPLR 3212 (a) provides
that "[a]ny party may move for summary judgment in any action[ ] after issue has been
joined; provided however, that the court may set a date after which no such motion may
be made, such date being no earlier than thirty days after the filing of the note of issue."
Here, issue was joined on or about October 5, 2011, when respondent served his answer
with counterclaims (see generally Airco Alloys Div. v Niagara Mohawk Power
Corp., 76 AD2d 68, 75 [1980]) and, therefore, respondent's contemporaneous
summary judgment motion was not premature (see CPLR 3212 [a]; cf. Coolidge Equities Ltd. v Falls
Ct. Props. Co., 45 AD3d 1289, 1289 [2007]; C.S. Behler, Inc. v Daly &
Zilch, 277 AD2d 1002, 1003 [2000]). Further, pursuant to the plain language of
CPLR 3212 (a), there is no merit to petitioner's position that a note of issue must be filed
before a party moves for summary judgment or before a court grants such a motion. We
thus conclude that the Surrogate did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion
pursuant to CPLR 5015 (a) inasmuch as petitioner failed to set forth any factual or legal
basis for his contentions concerning fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct on the
part of respondent, or for lack of jurisdiction on the part of the Surrogate (see Abbott v Crown Mill
Restoration Dev., LLC, 109 AD3d 1097, 1100 [2013]; Tribeca Lending Corp. v
Crawford, 79 AD3d 1018, 1020 [2010], lv dismissed 16 NY3d 783
[2011]; Pollock v Wilson,
26 AD3d 772, 772 [2006]; Utica Mut. Ins. Co. v East End Pools & Cts., 271
AD2d 526, 527 [2000], lv dismissed 95 NY2d 902 [2000]).

Petitioner further contends that he should have been granted a default judgment for a
sum certain pursuant to CPLR 3215 (a) inasmuch as respondent failed to appear in this
matter. As noted above, however, respondent did not fail to appear but, rather, filed an
answer with counterclaims. Petitioner therefore is not entitled to a default judgment for a
sum certain (see id.).

We conclude that the Surrogate did not abuse his discretion in ordering that
petitioner obtain court approval before filing any further pro se applications against
respondent, the estate, or the attorney for the estate (see Bikman v 595 Broadway Assoc., 88 AD3d 455,
455-456 [2011], lv denied 21 NY3d 856; Jones v Maples, 286 AD2d
639, 639 [2001], lv dismissed 97 NY2d 716 [2002]). Although "[p]ublic policy
mandates free access to the courts[,] . . . when a litigant is 'abusing the
judicial process by hagriding individuals solely out of ill will or spite, equity may enjoin
such vexatious litigation' " (Matter of Shreve v Shreve, 229 AD2d 1005, 1006
[1996], quoting Sassower v Signorelli, 99 AD2d 358, 359 [1984]; see Breytman v Schechter, 101
AD3d 783, 785 [2012], lv dismissed 21 NY3d 974 [2013]). Here, despite
numerous adverse determinations and repeated warnings by the Surrogate and, more
recently, by this Court (Matter
of Aarismaa v Bender, 108 AD3d 1203, 1205 [2013]), petitioner continues to
file frivolous and largely incomprehensible applications based on his erroneous beliefs
that issue was never joined and that a note of issue must be filed before a summary
judgment motion may be made and granted. We therefore conclude that the Surrogate
properly enjoined petitioner from continuing to use the legal system to harass respondent,
to deplete the assets of the estate, and to waste the time of the Surrogate and this Court
(see Ram v Torto, 111
AD3d 814, 815-816 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 
860 [2014]; Bikman, 88 AD3d at 455-456; Jones, 286 AD2d at 639).

In light of the frivolous nature of this appeal and petitioner's continued abuse of the
judicial system, we conclude that the imposition of costs is appropriate (see Burkhart v Modica, 81
AD3d 1356, 1358 [2011], lv dismissed 17 NY3d 850 [2011], lv denied
18 NY3d 853 [2011]; Ginther v Jones, 35 AD3d 1224, 1224 [2006], lv
denied 8 NY3d 810 [2007]). Finally, we conclude that, under the circumstances of
this case, sanctions are warranted (see 22 NYCRR 130-1.1; Ram, 111
AD3d at 816; Matter of Hirschfeld v Friedman, 307 AD2d 856, 859 [2003]). We
therefore remit the matter to the Surrogate to determine the amount of sanctions to be
imposed, following a hearing if necessary (see Burkhart, 81 AD3d at 1358;
Charles & Boudin v Meyer, 307 AD2d 272, 274 [2003]). Present—Smith,
J.P., Peradotto, Lindley, Sconiers and Valentino, JJ.
