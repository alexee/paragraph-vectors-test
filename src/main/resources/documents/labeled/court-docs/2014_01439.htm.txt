v
En-Consultants,
Inc., Appellant.


—[*1]


Esseks, Hefter & Angel, LLP, Riverhead, N.Y. (Patricia M. Carroll and
Anthony C. Pasca of counsel), for appellant.

Sinnreich Kosakoff & Messina LLP, Central Islip, N.Y. (Jonathan Sinnreich and
Lisa A. Perillo of counsel), for respondent.



In an action to recover damages for breach of contract, the defendant appeals from an
order of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (Farneti, J.), dated June 26, 2012, which
denied its motion pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (5) to dismiss the complaint as time-barred.

Ordered that the order is affirmed, with costs.

The plaintiff allegedly hired the defendant to prepare an application for a permit to
replace a bulkhead on the plaintiff's beachfront property in Montauk. The application the
defendant prepared included a proposed design for the replacement bulkhead. After the
plaintiff's permit application was approved by the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation, the plaintiff installed a replacement bulkhead that was
allegedly "substantially in accordance with" the design provided by the defendant. When
the replacement bulkhead failed within a year, the plaintiff commenced this action to
recover damages for breach of contract. The defendant moved pursuant to CPLR 3211
(a) (5) to dismiss the complaint as time-barred, and the Supreme Court denied the
motion.

On a motion pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (5) to dismiss a complaint as barred by the
applicable statute of limitations, the moving defendant must establish, prima facie, that
the time in which to commence the action has expired (see Landow v Snow Becker
Krauss, P.C., 111 AD3d 795, 796 [2013]; Zaborowski v Local 74, Serv. Empls. Intl. Union, AFL-CIO, 91
AD3d 768, 768-769 [2012]). An action to recover damages for breach of contract is
governed by a six-year statute of limitations period (see CPLR 213 [2]), while an
action alleging professional malpractice, with the exception of medical, dental, or
podiatric malpractice, is governed by a three-year statute of limitations period regardless
of whether the underlying theory is based in contract or tort (see CPLR 214 [6];
Castle Oil Corp. v Thompson Pension Empl. Plans, 299 AD2d 513, 514 [2002]).
Since "malpractice is professional misfeasance toward one's client" (Chase Scientific
Research v NIA Group, 96 NY2d 20, 24 [2001]), whether a person is a professional
is determined by reference to qualities that "include extensive formal learning and
training, licensure and regulation indicating a qualification to practice, a code of conduct
imposing standards beyond those accepted in the marketplace and a system of discipline
for violation of those standards," as well as a relationship "of trust and confidence,
carrying with it [*2]a duty to counsel and advise clients"
(id. at 29).

Here, the defendant failed to establish, prima facie, that it rendered professional
services to the plaintiff, and, thus, that the three-year statute of limitations for
professional malpractice should govern as opposed to the six-year statute of limitations
for breach of contract (see Pike
v New York Life Ins. Co., 72 AD3d 1043, 1048 [2010]; Castle Oil Corp. v
Thompson Pension Empl. Plans, 299 AD2d at 514). The single, conclusory
allegation in the complaint that the defendant relied upon as establishing that it is a
professional within the meaning of CPLR 214 (6) was insufficient to meet its prima facie
burden (see A.F. Rockland
Plumbing Supply Corp. v Hudson Shore Associated Ltd. Partnership, 96 AD3d
885, 886 [2012]; Lockwood v Layton, 79 AD3d 1342, 1344 [2010]; Fekete v Camp Skwere, 16
AD3d 544, 546 [2005]). The defendant did not submit any evidence addressing the
relevant factors to be considered in determining whether it "is a 'professional' within
[CPLR 214 (6)]" (96 NY2d at 24; see Pike v New York Life Ins. Co., 72 AD3d 1043, 1048
[2010]; Castle Oil Corp. v Thompson Pension Empl. Plans, 299 AD2d at 514).

The defendant's remaining contentions are not properly before this Court.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly denied the defendant's motion pursuant to
CPLR 3211 (a) (5) to dismiss the complaint as time-barred. Skelos, J.P., Chambers, Hall
and Miller, JJ., concur.
