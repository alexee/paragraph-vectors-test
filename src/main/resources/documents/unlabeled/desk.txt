A desk or bureau is a piece of furniture and a type of table often used in a school, office setting or home for various academic, professional or domestic activities such as reading, writing, or using technology such as a computer.[1][2] Desks are usually made of wood or metal, although materials such as tempered glass are sometimes seen.

Desks often have one or more drawers, compartments, or pigeonholes to store items such as office supplies and papers.[2] Unlike a regular table, usually only one side of a desk is suitable to sit at (though there are some exceptions, such as a partners desk).[3] Not all desks have the form of a table. For instance, an armoire desk[4] is a desk built within a large wardrobe-like cabinet, and a portable desk[5] is light enough to be placed on a person's lap. Since many people lean on a desk while using it, a desk must be sturdy. In most cases, people sit at a desk, either on a separate chair or a built-in chair (e.g., in some school desks). Some users stand at their desks using higher standing desks.
